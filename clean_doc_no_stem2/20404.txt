bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the states united in the folds of the bars the words god liberty law brbr this would make a beautiful coin to which no possible citizen could object this would relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism this would place us openly under the divine protection we have personally claimed from my hearth i have felt our national shame in disowning god

we trust marked out and an uniquelymade stamptoday the motto is a source of some controversyheated contention one side argues that a need for a separation of church and state in the united statesseparation of church and state requires that the motto be removed from all public use including on coins and paper money they argue that religionreligious freedom includes the right to believe in the nonexistence of god and that the gratuitous use of the motto infringes upon the religious rights of the unreligious they argue that any endorsement of god by the government is unconstitutional many also argue that the motto along with the addition of under god to the pledge of allegiance was made official simply because of us opposition to the atheismatheistic soviet union the main adversary of the united states at the time the other side of the argument states that the separation of church and state means that congress shall not impose a state religion on the populace and that the separation of church and state is a legislative invention not intended by the founding fathers they argue that religious language is used in the founding documents such as nature and natures god in the united states declaration of independencedeclaration of independence although opponents point out that the declaration is simply a historical rather than official document of the us governmentmoreover the emphasis on nature indicates a naturalistic deismdeist rather than christian philosophy the constitution lacks such references likewise the treaty of tripoli ratified by the senate and signed by john adams has become the subject of controversy because of this section blockquoteas the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquillity of musselmen and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mahometan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries blockquote interestingly theodore roosevelt argued against the requirement of the motto on coinage not because of a lack of faith in god but because he thought it sacrilegious to put the name of the deity on something so common as money this argument is rarely used by either side today whichever side of the argument is ultimately victorious will be determined at some point in the future either by judicial decision legislation or constitutional amendment but at this point use of the motto on circulating coinage is required by law some activists have been known to cross out the motto on paper money as a form of protest while several laws come into play the act of may 18 1908 is most often cited as requiring the motto even though the cent and nickel were excluded from that law and the nickel did not have the motto added until 1938 since 1938 all coins have borne the motto the use of the motto was permitted but not required by an 1873 law the motto was added to paper money over a period from 1957
