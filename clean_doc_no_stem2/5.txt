the greek words ancient and wordspeechdiscourse is the study of human cultures through the recovery documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data including architecture artifacts biofacts human remains and landscapes the goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human culture understand culture history chronicle cultural evolution and study human behaviour and ecology for both prehistoric and historic societies usage as with words such as encyclopedia and gynaecology archaeology traditionally has an ae combination however unlike other words the ae is all but universally retained contrary to popular belief in other parts of the world the spelling archeology is not predominant in united states dictionaries and would look quite odd to most americans like the claim that theater refers to a building and theatre refers to the performing arts the belief that archeology is an americanism is little more than an urban myth the traditional spelling archaeology continues to be used in everyday writing throughout the world including the u s even more so than theatre the alternate spelling of which while considered acceptable is preferred less often than not ontology and definition in the old world archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subjects goals the disciplines roots in antiquarianism and the study of latin and ancient greek provided it with a natural affinity with the field of history in the new world archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human societies and is treated as one of the four subfields of anthropology the other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology in a holistic manner these subfields are cultural anthropology which studies behavioural symbolic and material dimensions of culture linguistics which studies language including the origins of language and language groups and physical anthropology which includes the study of human evolution and physical and genetic characteristics other disciplines also supplement archaeology such as paleontology paleozoology paleoethnobotany paleobotany geography geology art history and classics archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the sciences to illuminate the humanities writing in 1948 the american archaeologist walter taylor asserted that archaeology is neither history nor anthropology as an autonomous discipline it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering or production of cultural information archaeology is an approach to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology in england archaeologists have uncovered the longlost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion in downtown new york city archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the black burial ground traditional archaeology is viewed as the study of prehistorical human cultures that is cultures that existed before the development of writing for that culture historical archaeology is the study of post writing cultures in the study of relatively recent cultures which have been observed and studied by western scholars archaeology is closely allied with ethnography this is the case in large parts of north america oceania siberia and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied kennewick man is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture in the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours history and archaeology supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context as at hadrians wall importance and applicability most of human history is not described by any written records writing did not exist anywhere in the world until about 5000 years ago and only spread among a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilisations in contrast homo sapiens have existed for at least 200 000 years and other species of homo for millions of years see human evolution these civilisations are not coincidentally the bestknown they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries while the study of prehistoric cultures has arisen only recently even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels many important human practices are not officially recorded any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation the development of agriculture cult practices of folk religion the rise of the first cities must come from archaeology even where written records do exist they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent in many societies literacy was restricted to the elite classes such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple the literacy even of an aristocracy has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts the interests and worldview of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity thus written records tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes and cannot be trusted as a sole source the material record is nearer to a fair representation of society though it is subject to its own inaccuracies such as sampling bias and differential preservation in addition to their scientific importance archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them monetary value to collectors or simply strong aesthetic appeal many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic religious political or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies this view is often espoused in works of popular fiction such as raiders of the lost ark the mummy and king solomons mines when such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents see pseudoarchaeology below however these endeavours real and fictional are not representative of the modern state of archaeology goals there is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies these include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains every phase of this process can be a source of information the goals of archaeology are not always the same there are at least three broad distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do these are beyond the scope of the present discussion and are discussed at length below nevertheless there is much common ground academic subdisciplines as with most academic disciplines there are a very large number of archaeological subdisciplines characterised by a specific method or type of material e g lithic analysis music archaeobotany geographical or chronological focus e g near eastern archaeology medieval archaeology other thematic concern e g landscape archaeology or a specific archaeological culture or civilisation e g egyptology cultural resources management cultural resources management crm also called heritage management in britain is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the united states and much of that in western europe as well in the united states crm archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the national historic preservation act of 1966 and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure in the united states the vast majority of taxpayers scholars and politicians believe that crm has helped to preserve much of that nations history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities dams and highways along with other statutes this mandates that no construction project on public land or involving public funds may damage an unstudied archaeological site the application of crm in the united kingdom is not limited to governmentfunded projects since 1990 ppg 16 has required planners to consider archaeology as a material consideration in determining applications for new development as a result numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of or during construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas at the developers expense among the goals of crm are the identification preservation and maintenance of cultural sites on public and private lands and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity such as proposed construction this study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction if these do exist time and money must be allotted for their excavation if initial survey andor test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site the construction may be prohibited entirely crm is a thriving entity especially in the united states and europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline cultural resources management has however been criticized crm is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget it is not unheardof for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding crm archaeologists face considerable time pressure often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour field methods survey a modern archaeological project often begins with a survey regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest such as houses and middens within a site each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace and excavating only the plainly visible features there gordon willey pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the viru valley of coastal peru and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to or even in place of excavation it requires relatively little time and expense because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts nevertheless surveying a large region or site can be expensive so archaeologists often employ sampling methods it avoids ethical issues of particular concern to descendant peoples associated with destroying a site through excavation it is the only way to gather some forms of information such as settlement patterns and settlement structure survey data are commonly assembled into maps which may show surface features andor artefact distribution the simplest survey technique is surface survey it involves combing an area usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth or overgrown with vegetation surface survey may also include miniexcavation techniques such as augers corers and shovel test pits aerial survey is conducted using cameras attached to aircraft balloons or even kites a birdseye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface plants growing above a stone structure such as a wall will develop more slowly while those above other types of features such as middens may develop more rapidly photographs of ripening grain which changes colour rapidly at maturation have revealed buried structures with great precision aerial survey also employs infrared groundpenetrating radar wavelengths and thermography geophysical survey is the most effective way to see beneath the ground magnetometers detect minute deviations in the earths magnetic field caused by iron artefacts kilns some types of stone structures and even ditches and middens devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used most soils are moist below the surface which gives them a relatively low resistivity features such as hardpacked floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on english civil war battlefields metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck and service cable location during evaluation metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context in the uk metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the portable antiquities scheme regional survey in maritime archaeology uses sidescan sonar excavation archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects it can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey such as stratigraphy threedimensional structure and verifiably primary context modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features known as their provenance or provenience be recorded this always involves determining their horizontal locations and sometimes vertical position as well also see primary laws of archaeology similarly their association or relationship with nearby objects and features needs to be recorded for later analysis this allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity for example excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research also as a destructive process it carries ethical concerns as a result very few sites are excavated in their entirety sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey it is common for large mechanical equipment such as backhoes jcbs to be used in excavation especially to remove the topsoil overburden though this method is increasingly used with great caution following this rather dramatic step the exposed area is usually handcleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent the next task is to form a site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation features dug into the natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible archaeological section for recording scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site black and white and colour photographs of them are taken and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each all this information serves as a permanent record of the nowdestroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site postexcavation analysis once artefacts and structures have been excavated or collected from surface surveys it is necessary to properly study them to gain as much data as possible this process is known as postexcavation analysis and is normally the most timeconsuming part of the archaeological investigation it is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published at its most basic the artefacts found are cleaned catalogued and compared to published collections in order to classify them typologically and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages however a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined the bones plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed using the techniques of zooarchaeology paleoethnobotany and palynology while any texts can usually be deciphered these techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site history of archaeology the history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation and the use of an increasing range of techniques to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts it was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals including augustus pitt rivers and william flinders petrie this process was continued in the 20th century by such people as mortimer wheeler whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained during the 20th century the development of urban archaeology and then rescue archaeology have been important factors as has the development of archaeological science which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain archaeological theory there is no single theory of archaeology and even definitions are disputed until the mid20th century and the introduction of technology there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology the first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural or culture history which was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the 1960s a number of young primarily american archaeologists such as lewis binford rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history they proposed a new archaeology which would be more scientific and anthropological with hypothesis testing and the scientific method very important parts of what became known as processual archaeology in the 1980s a new movement arose led by the british archaeologists michael shanks christopher tilley daniel miller and ian hodder it questioned processualisms appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism becoming known as postprocessual archaeology however this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour the validity of both processualism and postprocuessualism is still under debate archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences including neodarwinian evolutionary thought phenomenology postmodernism agency theory cognitive science functionalism genderbased and feminist archaeology and systems theory public archaeology early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities such pursuits continue to fascinate the public portrayed in books such as king solomons mines and films such as the mummy and raiders of the lost ark much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as copn and the valley of the kings but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational in addition archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern survey excavation and data processing techniques some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as pseudoarchaeology nevertheless archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of indiana jones films and tomb raider games as the inspiration for them to enter the field archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed without a strong public interest in the subject often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require in the uk popular archaeology programmes such as time team and meet the ancestors have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest where possible archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did however the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour and even this is less freely available than before developerfunded excavation necessitates a welltrained staff that can work quickly and accurately observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project there is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group pseudoarchaeology pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices it includes much fictional archaeological work discussed above as well as some actual activity many nonfiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology or the specific critiques of it contained in postprocessualism an example of this type is the writing of erich von dniken his chariots of the gods 1968 together with many subsequent lesserknown works expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations this theory known as palaeocontact theory is not exclusively dnikens nor did the idea originate with him works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of wellestablished theories on the basis of limited evidence and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind looting looting of archaeological sites by people in search of hoards of buried treasure is an ancient problem for instance many of the tombs of the egyptian pharaohs were looted in antiquity the advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples a brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the illicit antiquities trade which smuggles items abroad to private collectors looters damage the integrity of a historic site deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage the popular consciousness often associates looting with poor third world countries many are former homes to many wellknown ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites certainly the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmers income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people however looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the united states and western europe as well abandoned towns of the ancient sinagua people of arizona clearly visible in the desert landscape have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night with the metal detector a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig public outreach motivated by a desire to halt looting curb pseudoarchaeology and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work archaeologists are mounting publicoutreach campaigns they seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation the final audience for archaeologists work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them the putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites descendant peoples in the united states examples such as the case of kennewick man have illustrated the tensions between native americans and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them for years american archaeologists dug on indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study in some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied furthermore western archaeologists views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples the west views time as linear for many natives it is cyclic from a western perspective the past is longgone from a native perspective disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present to an archaeologist the past is longgone and must be reconstructed through its material remains to indigenous peoples it is often still alive as a consequence of this american indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors while american archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies this contradictory situation was addressed by the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra 1990 which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study archaeologists have also been obliged to reexamine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space to many native peoples natural features such as lakes mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study while this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork it has benefits for all parties involved tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred while the archaeologists gain the elders aid in interpreting their finds there have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession repatriation a new trend in the heated controversy between first nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts to the original descendants an example of this occurred june 21 2005 when a community members and elders from a number of the 10 algonquian nations in the ottawa area convened on the kitigan zibi reservation in kanawagi quebec to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods some dating back 6 000 years the ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles the remains and artifacts including beads tools and weapons were originally excavated from various sites in the ottawa valley including morrison and the allumette islands they had been part of the canadian museum of civilizations research collection for decades some since the late 1800s elders from various algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial eventually deciding on traditional redcedar and birchbark boxes lined with redcedar chips muskrat and beaver pelts now an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 90 boxes of various sizes are buried although negotiations were at times tense between the kitigan zibi community and museum they were able to reach agreement
