mengulangi file diunduh lengkap wget salah klien memanfaatkan thennew coderangecode list of http headershttp header mendukung fitur pengunduhan rekursif wget can optionally work like a web crawler by extracting resources hyperlinklinked from html web pagepages and downloading them in sequence repeating the process recursionrecursively until all the pages have been downloaded or a maximum recursion depth specified by the user has been reached the downloaded pages are saved in a directory structure resembling that on the remote server this recursive download enables partial or complete mirroring of web sites via http links in downloaded html pages can be adjusted to point to locally downloaded material for offline viewing when performing this kind of automatic mirror computingmirroring of web sites wget supports the robots exclusion standard unless you provide the option codee robotsoffcode recursive download works with file transfer protocolftp as well where wget issues the codelistcode command to find which additional files to download repeating this process for directories and files under the one specified in the top uniform resource locatorurl shelllike wildcard characterwildcards are supported when the download of ftp urls is requested when downloading recursively over either http or file transfer protocolftp wget can be instructed to inspect the timestamps of local and remote files and download only the remote files newer than the corresponding local ones this allows easy mirroring of http and file transfer protocolftp sites but is considered inefficient and more errorprone when compared to programs designed for mirroring from the ground up such as rsync on the other hand wget doesnt require special serverside software for this task ketidakinteraktifan wget is noninteractive in the sense that once started it does not require user interaction and does not need to control a tty being able to log its progress to a separate file for later inspection that way the user can start wget and log outlog off leaving the program unattended by contrast most graphical user interfacegraphical or text user interface web browsers require the user to remain logged in and to manually restart failed downloads which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data portabilitas written in a highly portable style of c programming languagec with minimal dependencies on thirdparty libraries wget requires little more than a c compiler and a bsdlike interface to transmission control protocoltcpip networking designed as a unix program invoked from the unix shell the program has been ported to numerous unixlike environments and systems such as microsoft windows via cygwin and mac os x fitur wget supports download through proxy serverproxies which are widely deployed to provide web access inside company firewall networkingfirewalls and to cache and quickly deliver frequently accessed content it makes use of persistent http connections where available ipv6 is supported on systems that include the appropriate interfaces transport layer securityssltls is supported for encrypted downloads using the openssl library files larger than 2

assignments for all nontrivial contributions to gnu software httpwww gnu orglicenseswhyassign html sejarah sejarah wget is the descendant of an earlier program named geturl by the same author the development of which commenced in late 1995 the name was changed to wget after the author became aware of an earlier amiga program named geturl written by james burton in arexx wget filled a gap in the web downloading software available in the mid1990s no single program was able to reliably download files via both http and file transfer protocolftp protocol computingprotocols existing programs either only supported ftp such as ncftp and ftpgnjilux srk fer hrpubunixutildl dl or were written in perl which was not yet ubiquitous at the time while wget was inspired by features of some of the existing programs it aimed to support both http and ftp and to enable the users to build it using only the standard development tools found on every unix system at that time many unix users struggled behind extremely slow university and dialup accessdialup internet connections leading to a growing need for a downloading agent that could deal with transient network failures without assistance from the human operator rilis wajar the following releases represent notable milestones in wgets development features listed next to each release are edited for brevity and do not constitute comprehensive

distributed under an adhoc nowarranty software licenselicense wget 1 4 3 released february 1997 was the first version released as part of gnuthe gnu project with the copyright assigned to the free software foundationfsf wget 1 5 3 released september 1998 was a milestone in the programs popularity this version was bundled with many linux distributions which exposed the program to a much wider audience wget 1 6 released december 1999 incorporated many bug fixes for the by then stale 1 5 3 release largely thanks to the effort of harkless wget 1 7 released june 2001 introduced transport layer securityssl support http cookiecookies and persistent connections wget 1 8 released december 2001 added bandwidth throttling new progress indicators and the breadthfirst traversal of the hyperlink graph mathematicsgraph wget 1 9 released october 2003 included experimental ipv6 support and ability to post data to http servers wget 1 10 released june 2005 introduced large file support ipv6 support on dualfamily systems ntlm authorization and transport layer securityssl improvements the maintainership was picked up by mauro tortonesi wget 1 11 released january 2008 moved to version 3 of the gnu general public license and added preliminary support for the codecontentdispositioncode header which is often used by common gateway interfacecgi scripts to indicate the name of a file for downloading securityrelated improvements were also made to the http authentication code micah cowan took over maintainership of the project daur rilis pengembangan wget is developed in an open fashion most of the design decisions typically being discussed on the public mailing list httpnews gmane orggmane comp web wget general followed by users and developers bug reports are relayed to the same list kontribusi sumber the preferred method of contributing to wgets code and documentation is through source updates in the form of textual patch unixpatches generated by the diff utility patches intended for inclusion in wget are submitted to a designated mailing list httpnews gmane orggmane comp web wget patches where they are reviewed by the maintainers patches that pass the maintainers scrutiny are installed in the sources and all others are rejected instructions on patch creation as well as style guidelines are outlined in the patches document provided with the distribution httpsvn dotsrc orgrepowgettrunkpatches mostly based on the gnu coding standards httpwww gnu orgprepstandards because all changes go through this list even ones from core developers the subscribers to the list can track wget development and provide feedback the source code can also be tracked via a remote version control repository that hosts revision history beginning with the 1 5 3 release the repository is running mercurial softwaremercurial previously it had been hosted on subversion softwaresubversion and prior to that via concurrent versions systemcvs rilis when a sufficient number of features or bug fixes accumulate during development wget is released to the general public via the gnu ftp site and its mirrors being entirely run by volunteers there is no external pressure to issue a release nor are there enforceable release deadlines releases are numbered as versions of the form of major minor revision such as wget 1 11 or wget 1 8 2 an increase of the major version number represents large and possibly incompatible changes in wgets behavior or a radical redesign of the code base an increase of the minor version number designates addition of new features and bug fixes a new revision indicates a release that compared to the previous revision only contains bug fixes revision zero is omitted meaning that for example wget 1 11 is the same as 1 11 0 wget does not use the oddeven release number convention popularized by the linux kernelkernel linux at any moment there are two branches of development the trunk where new features get added and the stable branch forked after each minor release where only the bug fixes are applied all revisionlevel releases are built off the stable branch all minor version releases are built off the trunk lisensi gnu wget is distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license version 3 or later with a special openssl exceptionexception that allows distribution of binaries linkerlinked against the openssl library the text of the exception follows blockquote additional permission under gnu gpl version 3 section 7 if you modify this program or any covered work by linking or combining it with the openssl projects openssl library or a modified version of that library containing parts covered by the terms of the openssl or ssleay licenses the free software foundation grants you additional permission to convey the resulting work corresponding source for a nonsource form of such a combination shall include the source code for the parts of openssl used as well as that of the covered work blockquote it is expected that the exception clause will be removed once wget is modified to also linkerlink with the gnutls library wgets documentation in the form of a texinfo reference manual is distributed under the terms of the gnu free documentation license version 1 2 or later the man page usually distributed on unixlike systems is automatically generated from a subset of the texinfo manual and falls under
