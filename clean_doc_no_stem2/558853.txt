filesimhat torah 17th century jpgthumbthrowing cakes to children on simat torah by johann leusden in philologus hebromixtus utrecht 1657 the simhat torah festivities begin with the evening service all the synagogues torah scrolls are removed from the ark synagogueark and are carried around the sanctuary in a series of seven hakafot circuits although each hakafa need only encompass one circuit around the synagogue the dancing and singing with the torah often continues much longer and may overflow from the synagogue onto the streets in orthodox and conservative jewish synagogues each circuit is announced by a few melodious invocations imploring god to hoshiah na save us and ending with the refrain aneinu byom koreinu god answer us on the day we call in orthodox and conservative synagogues the hakafot are accompanied by traditional chants including biblical and liturgical verses and songs about the torah the goodness of god jewish messianiasmmessianic yearnings and prayers for the restoration of the davidic linehouse of david and the temple in jerusalem congregations may also sing other popular songs during the dancing children are often given flags candies and other treats the vigour of the dancing and degree of festive merriment varies with congregational temperament in orthodox synagogues the dancing is mainly carried out by men and boys children even young girls may also dance with their fathers women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the torah scrolls or look on from the other side of a mechitza partition in accordance with the rules of tzniut modesty in conservative and progressive congregations men and women dance together in some congregations the torah scrolls are carried out into the streets and the dancing may continue far into the evening after the hakafot many congregations recite a portion of the last parashah of the torah vzot haberachah this is the blessing in deuteronomy the part read is usually 3313412 but may vary by synagogue custom although deuteronomy is never read to the end in the evening morning festivities the morning service like that of other jewish holidays includes a special holiday amidah the saying of hallel and a holiday mussaf service when the ark is opened to take out the torah for the torah reading all the scrolls are again removed from the ark and the congregation again starts the seven hakafot just like in the evening early priestly blessing in many congregations one deviation from an otherwise ordinary holiday morning service is the performance of the priestly blessing as part of the shacharit service before the celebrations connected with the torah reading begin rather than as part of the musaf service that follows this practice hearkens back to an old custom for the kiddush sponsored by the hatan torah see below to be held during the simhat torah service itself where hard liquor along with other refreshments may be served since the bible prohibits kohenkohanim descendants of aaron from performing the priestly blessing while intoxicated and there is concern that kohanim may imbibe alcoholic beverages during the simhat torah festivities the blessing was moved to before the time when alcohol would be served refhttpwww chaburas orgsimchatora html simchat torah chaburanetref in some congregations the kohanim deliver their blessing as usual during the musaf service of simhat torah in some congregations in israel the kohanim deliver their blessing at both shacharit and musaf services torah reading and customs after the hakafot and the dancing three scrolls of the torah are read the last parashah of the torah vzot haberachah at the end of deuteronomy 3313412 is read from the first scroll followed immediately by the first chapter and part of the second of the book of genesis 1123 which is read from the second scroll it is a jewish custom that a new beginning must immediately follow a completion therefore it is logical to immediately read gen 1 after finishing deuteronomy it is a special honor to receive the last aliyah of the book of deuteronomy the person receiving that aliyah is called the hatan torah the groom of the torah or kallat torah the bride of the torah in synagogues that allow women to receive an aliyah likewise it is a special honor to receive the first aliyah of the book of genesis that person is called hatan breishit the groom of genesis or kallat breishit the bride of genesis in many congregations it is customary to call all eligible members of the congregation for an baal korealiyah to the torah on simhat torah to accommodate this the first five aliyot are reread so that everyone has an opportunity to recite the blessing to save time some congregations call people up in groups others hold a series of separate minyanim for the torah reading in a minority of orthodox congregations women receive aliyot in singlegender tefillah groups prayer groups consisting only of women who pray together and only men are called to the torah in front of the whole congregation another custom is to call all the children in orthodox congregations boys only to a special aliyah called kol hanearim all the children in many congregations a large talit is spread out over the heads of all the children as the blessing over the torah is pronounced and for the congregation to bless the children by reciting in hebrew a verse from jacobs blessing to ephraim and manasseh tribal patriarchmanasseh book of genesisgenesis 4816 may the angel who redeems me from all evil bless the children and may my name be declared among them and the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they teem like fish for multitude within the land although the blessing of the children is omitted from the 1985 edition of conservative judaisms siddur sim shalom prayer book it was reinstated in later versions most conservative congregations still perform it after the portion of genesis is read the maftir book of numbersnumbers 2935301 is read from a third torah scroll the passage describes the prescribed korbanofferings performed for the holiday the haftarah reading from the prophets is the first section of the book of joshua history the name simhat torah was not used until a relatively late time in the talmud megillah talmudmeg 31b it is called shemini atzeret the darchei moshe oc 6693 cites a history of responsa in judaismresponsum from joseph colon trabottor joseph colon 26 who found a geonimgeonic responsa mentioning the custom of dancing on simhat torah thus dating the current practice of dancing on simhat torah to the 1st century ace in the 9th century some european jewish communities assigned a special reading from the prophets to be read on this day in the 14th century the reading of genesis was added immediately upon the completion of deuteronomy and the shulchan aruchshulhan arukh written about 1565refoc see mishnah berurah volume 6 page 272ref only mentions this without mentioning the presumably later custom of southern european countries to remove all the torah scrolls from the ark and to sing a separate hymn for each one in northern european countries those who had finished the reading of deuteronomy made donations to the synagogue after which the wealthier members of the community would give a dinner for friends and acquaintances by the end of the 15th century it was a common though not universal practice for the children to tear down and burn the sukkahs on simhat torah refmaharil cited in oc darchei moshe 6693ref in the 16th century the practice of taking out the scrolls and filing solemnly around the bimah on the night of the 23rd of tishri became customary and on the same evening after the procession a number of passages from the torah were read in the 17th century rebecca bat meir tiktiner of prague composed a poem about simhat torah in poland it was the custom to sell to the members of the congregation on the 23rd of tishri the privilege of executing various functions during the services on shabbat and jewish festivals ie the synagogue used this occasion as a fundraiser people who made these donations were called up to the torah and given a
