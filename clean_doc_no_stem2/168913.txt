particular danger for christians as the partisans of evil were now far more open as evidenced by the new openness of freemasonry freemasonry had been condemned by previous popes as contrary to christian doctrine but the nature if not beliefs of freemasonry was changing as freemasons were now far more open in their practices and affiliations the encyclical specifically condemned certain practices of the freemasons such as religious indifferenceref nameallcreedsagain as all who offer themselves are received whatever may be their form of religion they thereby teach the great error of this agethat a regard for religion should be held as an indifferent matter and that all religions are alike paragraph 16 httpwww ewtn comlibraryencycl13human htm humanum genusref the promotion of public education which denied the churchs role and where the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymenref namelaymenwith the greatest unanimity the sect of the freemasons also endeavors to take to itself the education of youth they think that they can easily mold to their opinions that soft and pliant age and bend it whither they will and that nothing can be more fitted than this to enable them to bring up the youth of the state after their own plan therefore in the education and instruction of children they allow no share either of teaching or of discipline to the ministers of the church and in many places they have procured that the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen and that nothing which treats of the most important and most holy duties of men to god shall be introduced into the instructions on morals paragraph 21 httpwww ewtn comlibraryencycl13human htm humanum genusref the approval of the notion that the people are the only source of sovereignty and that those who rule have no authority but by the commission and concession of the people factdatefebruary 2007 it had long been a practice of the church to forbid roman catholic churchcatholics from becoming freemasons often backed up by temporal governments which remains the official stand of the roman catholic church to this day principles condemned humanum genus criticises a number of principles for example the idea popular sovereignty is the source of all rights and that man should bend to no authority other than himself this condemnation is consistent with jeffersonian principles which limits popular sovereignty by rights endowed by their creator blockquotethen come their doctrines of politics in which the naturalists lay down that all men have the same right and are in every respect of equal and like condition that each one is naturally free that no one has the right to command another that it is an act of violence to require men to obey any authority other than that which is obtained from themselves ref namepara22paragraph 22 httpwww ewtn comlibraryencycl13human htm humanum genusrefemphasis addedblockquote finally it condemns what it sees as the masonic idea of the total separation of religion and state blockquoteit is held also that the state should be without god that in the various forms of religion there is no reason why one should have precedence of another and that they are all to occupy the same place ref namepara22paragraph 22 httpwww ewtn comlibraryencycl13human htm humanum genusrefemphasis addedblockquote latar
