on the lower walls have decayed to leave almost no trace except on the right wall fragments of virgin and child with an angel by cimabue these frescoes executed in tempera on dry plaster were completed about 12601263 they are considered by many as the best examples of tuscan wall paintings prior to cimabue as the popularity of this church increased side chapels for noble families were added between 1270 and 1350 destroying the frescoes on the opened walls the first chapel on the left is dedicated to saint martin of tours it was built by cardinal da montefiore and was decorated

enthroned and saint francis 1280 this is probably the nearest likeness to st francis this static painting in gothic style is in stark contrast with the lively frescoes of giotto this chapel of saint nicholas of bari at the northern end of the transept was commissioned by the papal legate cardinal orsini familynapoleone orsini and it contains the tomb of the cardinals brother giovanni orsini who died between 1292 and 1294 the funerary monument is set in a niche above the altar with the recumbent effigy of a young man placed inside a mortuary chamber and flanked by two angels the reliefs were carved by an umbrian sculptor probably of local origin between the tomb and the stained glass window appears a frescoed triptych attributed to giottos school representing the madonna and child with saint francis and nicholas the cycle decorating the walls of the chapel completed by 1307 comprises twelve scenes painted on the ceiling and on the walls illustrating the life and miracles of st nicholas a scene of the chapels dedication is painted above the arch of the entrance on the southern wall the redeemer receives the homage of giovanni orsini presented by st nicholas and of napoleone orsini presented by saint francis the stained glass windows show cardinal napoleone presented to christ in the summit and his brother presented to saint nicholas in the zone below at the southern end of the transept cardinal orsini commissioned another chapel dedicated to st john the baptist which was probably originally built for the tomb of napoleone orsini himself but the cardinal was never buried there and the tomb remained empty the parallel architectural arrangement of both orsini chapels suggests that they were conceived together however the decorations of the chapel dedicated to saint john the baptist were never finished pietro lorenzetti or his workshop executed a frescoed triptych with a madonna and child with saints john the baptist and francis berkaspietro lorenzetti 002

and also wrongly to giotto and puccio capanna this cycle of tempera frescoes are his masterworks they depict six scenes from the passion of christ the fresco of deposition of the cross is especially emotional there were about 330 workstages needed to complete this cycle beneath the monumental crucifixion scene pietro lorenzetti has executed a fresco of madonna and child accompanied by saints john the evangelist and saint francis the socalled madonna dei tramonti the fresco is accompanied by a frescoed niche containing the liturgical implements and a fictive bench gallery gallery the

different impression large glass stained windows placed halfway up the walls shed their coloured light on the masterworks of giotto and cimabue the windows in the choir were produced by german craftsmen active around assisi in the last part of the 13th century the windows on the left hand side of the nave were made by a french workshop 1270 while those on the right hand side are attributed to the workshop of maestro san francesco these stained glass windows are among the best examples of 13th c italian glasswork this bright and spacious basilica consists of a single fourbay nave with crossvaulted ceiling bordered with patterns of crosses and leaves a transept and a polygonal apse the four ribbed vaults are decorated alternately with golden stars on a blue background and paintings

many frescoes by cimabue and his workshop starting in c 1280 the magnificent crucifixion with st francis on his knees at the foot of the cross stresses again the veneration of the passion of christ by st francis sadly the frescoes of cimabue soon suffered from damp and decay due to the use of lead oxide in his colours and to the fact that the colours were applied when the plaster was no longer fresh they have deteriorated and have been reduced to photographic negatives prior to him there had been some decorations in the upper right hand section of the transept by an anonymous northern master probably an english artist 12671270 he realized the two lunettes and the roundels on the west wall with paintings of the angel and the apostles another anonymous master the roman master painted

since it took about six months to paint one bay of the nave different roman and tuscan masters followers of cimabue have performed this series of scenes such as giacomo jacopo torriti and pietro cavallini the two frescoes of the life of isaac isaac blesses jacob and esau in front of isaac in the middle register of the third bay are traditionally ascribed to the young giotto 12901295 previously wrongly ascribed to cimabue by vasari but even this has been controversial many critics esteem these the work of the anonymous isaac master and his workshop deducing from stylistic details attesting to his roman background some think that the isaac master may have been pietro cavallini or a follower pietro cavallini had painted around 1290 a similar fresco isaac blessing jacob in the convent of the church santa cecilia in trastevere in rome the position of the resting isaac looks like the same position of the virgin in cavallinis mosaic birth of the virgin in the apse of the

are the series of 28 frescoes ascribed to the young giotto along the lower part of the nave each bay contains three frescoes above the dado architecturedado on each side of the nave two frescoes in the east galleries beside the entrance and two more on the entrance wall giotto used the legenda maior the biography of st francis by st bonaventure 1266 to reconstruct the major events in the life of st francis the prototype for this cycle may have been the now lost st francis cycle by pietro cavallini in the church san francesco a ripa in rome the paintings are so vivid as if giotto had been a witness to these events according to vasari they were executed in the period between 1296 and 1304 however the authorship of giotto is disputed due to the ambiguous attributions given in early descriptions of this work many italian critics continue to support the authorship of giotto and his workshop but because of small differences in style with the frescoes of isaac it is thought that several or even all of these frescoes were painted by at least three separate painters using the original concept of giotto the master of legend of st francis the principal painter and probable supervisor of the cycle the master of the obsequies of st francis and the cecilia master the first span of the ceiling is decorated with frescoes of the four doctors of the church jerome augustine
