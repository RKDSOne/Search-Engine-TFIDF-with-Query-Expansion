priest at the southern end of the piazza spagna the architectural complex of the propoaganda fide was developed in the triangular urban block between the via due macelli and the via del collegio propaganda fide two streets which diverged from the piazza in 1634 a small oval chapel was built according to designs by bernini in 1642 father valerio with bernini redesigned the faade to the piazza spagna and the development was continued along the via due macelli by gaspare devecchio from 16391645 ref blunt a guide to baroque rome granada 1982 246ref in 1648 borromini took over and made various proposals that included demolishing berninis chapel which must have been particularly galling for the latter as he could see the building from his house on via mercede ref blunt 1982 166ref initially borromini designed an elongated oval chapel plan but this was superseded by a rectilinear design with the greater length parallel to the street and with curved corners on the interior construction of the chapel commenced in 1660 and although the main part was built by 1665 some of the decoration was carried out after his death ref magnuson t rome in the age of bernini vol 2 2067ref the re magi chapel dedicated to the three kings has a plan with four side chapels and galleries above on the interior the wall and the vault are differentiated horizontally by a cornice line but there is a vertical continuity of wall and vault which allows for windows at the base of the vault the wall pilasters are continued in the vault as ribs that crisscross and unite the space unlike his design at the oratory of philip neri oratorio dei filippini where the ribs are interrupted by the oval fresco at the centre of the vault the criss cross arrangement in the re magi chapel is such that an octagon is formed at the centre embellished with a dove of the holy spirit bathed in golden rays his first designs for the faade onto the via propaganda fide had five bays but he expanded this to seven the faade is dominated by the giant pilasters that originally supported a balustrade above the narrow entablature but later extensions obliterated the balustrade the central bay of the faade is a concave curve with angled pies at its edges perhaps in recognition that this faade would always be seen at an oblique angle because of the narrowness of the street the central door leads into the courtyard where borromini intended a curved arcade but this was not built refblunt 1979 246ref only the left hand side of the faade relates to the chapel and the right to the stair and entrance to the college

propaganda fide in 1651 founded in 1622 by pope gregory xvs bull inscrutabili divinae the body was charged with fostering the spread of catholicism and with the regulation of catholic ecclesiastical affairs in noncatholic countries the intrinsic importance of its duties and the extraordinary extent of its authority and of the territory under its jurisdiction caused the cardinal catholicismcardinal prefect of propaganda to be known as the red pope at the time of its inception the expansion of colonialismcolonial administrations was coming to be largely in netherlandsdutch and englandenglish hands both protestant countries intent on spreading these religious doctrines and rome perceived the very real threat of protestantism spreading in the wake of commercial empire by 1648 with the end of the thirty years war the official religious balance of established christianity in europe was permanently stabilized but new fields for evangelization were offered by vast regions of asia africa and the americas then being explored there had already been a less formally instituted cardinal committee concerned with propaganda fide since the time of pope gregory xiii 15721585 who were especially charged with promoting the union with rome of the longestablished eastern christian communities slavs greeks demographics of syriasyrians egyptians and abyssinians this was the traditional direction for the catholic church to look for evangelizing catechisms were printed in many languages and seminarians sent to places as far as malabar the most concrete result was the union with rome of the ruthenian catholic communion most concentrated in modern day ukraine and belarus the union was union of brestformalized at brest in 1508 the death of pope gregory xvgregory xv the following year did not interrupt the organization because cardinal barberini one of the original thirteen members of the congregation became the next pope as pope urban viiiurban viii 16231644 under urban viii a central seminary the collegium urbanum was set up for training missionaries the congregation also operated the polyglot printing press in rome printing catechisms in many languages their procurators were especially active in china from 1705 moving between macau and guangzhoucanton before finally settling in hong kong in 1842 in strongly protestant areas the operations of the congregation were considered subversive the first missionary to be killed was in grisons switzerland in april 1622 before the papal bull authorizing its creation had been disseminated in ireland after catholic emancipation 1829 while the established church was still the protestant church of ireland the irish catholic church came under the control of the congregation in 1833 and soon reformed itself
