nine opposition parties united as the pakistan national alliance ran an apparently popular campaign against bhuttos ppp when the ppp won a decisive victory in the parliamentary round of the elections the pna accused bhuttos party of rigging the vote and withdrew in protest from upcoming provincial elections widespread street fighting broke out and opposition politicians were arrested as the situation deterioated bhutto and pna leaders started negotiations for a peaceful conclusion of the confrontation after protracted negotiations agreement was finally agreed upon at the end of june 1977 the day after the agreement martial law was imposed by the army downfall and trial on july 5 1977 the military led by general muhammad ziaulhaq staged a coup zia relieved bhutto of power holding him

held in the presence of bhutto his party would not return to power again upon his release bhutto traveled the country amid adulatory crowds of ppp supporters he used to take the train traveling from the south to the north and on the way would address public meetings at different stations several of these trains were late some by days in reaching their respective destinations and as a result bhutto was banned from traveling by train the last visit he made to the city of multan in the province of punjab was marked the turning point in bhuttos political career and ultimately his life in spite of the administrations efforts to block the gathering the crowd was so large that it became disorderly providing an opportunity for the administration to declare that bhutto had been taken into custody because the people were against him and it had become necessary to protect him from the masses for his own safety on september 3 the army arrested bhutto again on charges of authorizing the murder of a political opponent in march of 1974 a 35yearold politician ahmed raza kasuri tried to run as a ppp candidate in elections despite having previously left the party the ppp rebuffed him three years earlier kasuri and his family had been ambushed leaving kasuris father nawab mohammad ahmad khan dead kasuri claimed that he was the actual target accusing bhutto of being the mastermind kasuri later claimed that he had been the victim of 15 assassination attempts bhutto was released 10 days after his arrest after a judge justice kma samadani found the evidence contradictory and incomplete justice samadani had to pay for this he was immediately removed from the court and placed at the disposal of law ministry three days later zia arrested bhutto again on the same charges this time under martial law when the ppp organized demonstrations among bhuttos supporters zia canceled the upcoming elections bhutto was arraigned before the high court of lahore instead of in a lower court thus automatically depriving him of one level of appeal the judge who had granted him bail was removed five new judges were appointed headed by chief justice of lahore high court maulvi mustaq who denied bail the trial would last five months and bhutto appeared in court on a dock specially built for the trial proceedings began on october 24 1977 masood mahmood the director general of the federal security force since renamed the federal investigation agency testified against bhutto mahmood had been arrested immediately after zias coup and had been imprisoned for two months prior to taking the stand in his testimony he claimed bhutto had ordered kasuris assassination and that four members of the federal security force had organized the ambush on bhuttos orders the 4 alleged assassins were arrested and later confessed they were brought into court as coaccused but one of them recanted his testimony declaring that it had been extracted from him under torture the following day the witness was not present in court the prosecution claimed that he had suddenly fallen ill bhuttos defense challenged the prosecution with proof from an army logbook the prosecution had submitted it showed that the jeep allegedly driven during the attack on kasuri was not even in lahore at the time the prosecution had the logbook disregarded as incorrect during the defenses crossexamination of witnesses the bench often interrupted questioning the 706page official transcript contained none of the objections or inconsistencies in the evidence pointed out by the defense former u s attorney general ramsey clark who attended the trial wrote the prosecutions case was based entirely on several witnesses who were detained until they confessed who changed and expanded their confessions and testimony with each reiteration who contradicted themselves and each other who except for masood mahmood were relating what others said whose testimony led to four different theories of what happened absolutely uncorroborated by an eyewitness direct evidence or physical evidence when bhutto began his testimony on january 25 1978 chief justice maulvi mustaq closed the courtroom to all observers bhutto responded by refusing to say any more bhutto demanded a retrial accusing the chief justice of bias after mustaq allegedly insulted bhuttos home province the court refused his demand on march 18 1978 bhutto was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death bhutto did not seek an appeal while he was transferred to a cell in rawalpindi central jail his family appealed on his behalf and a hearing before the supreme court commenced in may bhutto was given one week to prepare bhutto issued a thorough rejoinder to the charges although zia blocked its publication chief justice s anwarul haq adjourned the court until the end of july 1978 supposedly because 5 of the 9 appeals court judges were willing to overrule the lahore verdict one of the probhutto judges was due to retire in july chief justice s anwarul haq presided over the trial despite being close to zia even serving as acting president when zia was out of the country bhuttos lawyers managed to secure bhutto the right to conduct his own defense before the supreme court on december 18 1978 bhutto made his appearance in public before a packed courtroom in rawalpindi by this time he had been on death row for 9 months and had gone without fresh water for the previous 25 days he addressed the court for four days speaking without notes the appeal was completed on december 23 1978 on february 6 1979 the supreme court issued its verdict guilty a decision reached by a bare 4to3 majority the bhutto family had 7 days in which to appeal the court granted a stay of execution while it studied the petition by february 24 1979 when the next court hearing began appeals for clemency arrived from many heads of state zia said that the appeals amounted to trade union activity among politicians before his appeal zia sent him a messenger to bhutton in jail and said if hebhutto asks for forgivness from zia then hell let him go in return bhutto asked the person do you know my fathers name and the person said of course shah nawaz bhutto he then asked do you know zias father name to which he replied no bhutto then said my father wasis a legend and what about his father why should i ask for forgivness specially from a person who doesnt even have a father no one knows his fathers name on march 24 1979 the supreme court dismissed the appeal zia upheld the death sentence on april 4 1979 bhutto was hanged political legacy wikiquote the constitution of 1973 passed unanimously is a direct legacy of zulfikar ali bhutto the role of islam in the state the degree of provincial
