energyus department of energys health and environmental research programs the goals and general strategy of the project were outlined in a twopage memo to the assistant secretary in april 1986 which helped garner support from the doe the omb and congress especially senator pete dominici a series of scientific advisory meetings and complex negotiations with senior federal officials resulted in a line item for the project in the 1987 presidential budget submission to the congress initiation of the project was the culmination of several years of work supported by the us department of energy in particular a feasibility workshop in 1986 and a subsequent httpwww ornl govscitechresourceshumangenomeprojectherac2 shtml detailed description of the human genome initiative in a report that led to the formal sanctioning of the initiative by the department of energyfn1 this 1987 report stated boldly the ultimate goal of this initiative is to understand the human genome and knowledge of the human genome is as necessary to the continuing progress of medicine and other health sciences as knowledge of human anatomy has been for the present state of medicine candidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985fn2 the research funding3 billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the united states department of energy and the u s national institutes of health and was expected to take 15 years due to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of genomics especially in sequence analysis as well as huge advances in computing technology a rough draft of the genome was finished in 2000 announced jointly by us president bill clinton and united kingdombritish prime minister of the united kingdomprime minister tony blair on june 26 2000 two years earlier than planned president clinton had already awarded the citizens medal to delisi for his seminal role in the project in january 2000 before the completion of the project was announced the consortium comprised china france germany japan united kingdom united states eight years after the hgp was begun an identical quest was initiated separately with private venture capital by a company called celera genomics founded by craig venter while the hgp was still being pursued celera genomics used a newer albeit riskier technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing and proceeded at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the research fundingtaxpayerfunded project approximately 3 billion of taxpayer dollars versus about 300 million of private research funding celera had announced from the start its intent to make their genome freely available like that of the publiclyfunded hgp and in line with the bermuda statement feb 1996 made freely available to the public 24 hours a day nonetheless president clinton announced that the genome sequence could not be patented the statement sent celeras stock plummeting and the nasdaq in particular the biotech sector into a precipitous decline the biotech sector lost approximiately 50 billion in market capitalization in two days although the working draft was announced in june 2000 it was not until february 2001 that celera and the hgp scientists published actual details of their drafts special issues of nature journalnature which published the publiclyfunded projects scientific paper and science journalscience which published celeras paper contained descriptions of the methods used to produce the draft sequence as well as analysis of said sequence these drafts are hoped to comprise a scaffold of 90 of the genome with gaps to be filled later the competition between the rivals proved to be very good for the project and they agreed to pool their data ultimately the pooling agreement fell apart though when celera refused to deposit its data in genbank an unrestricted public database celera did incorporate the public data into their genome but the public effort was not permitted to use or merge the celera data with theirs on april 14 2003 a joint httpwww genoscope cns frexternechodeenglishactualitespressehgphgppressrelease140403 pdf press release announced that the project had been successfully completed by both groups with 99 of the genome sequenced with 99 99 accuracy each draft sequence has been checked at least four to five times to increase depth of coverage or accuracy approximately 47 of the draft were highquality sequences the final version will have been checked eight to nine times giving an error rate of just 1 in 10 000 bases the human genome project is one of a number of international genome projects in biology each aimed at sequencing the dna of a specific organism while the human dna sequence offers the most tangible benefits important developments in biology and medicine are predicted as a result of the sequencing of model organisms including mice fruitflies zebrafish yeast nematodes and many microbial organisms and parasites in october 2004 researchers of the hgp announced a new estimate of 20 000 to 25 000 genes in the human genome previously 30 000 to 40 000 had been predicted while estimates at the start of the project reached up to as high as 100 000 tujuan tujuan hgp mengembangkan senjata teknologi umat manusia the sequence of the human dna is stored in databases available to anyone on the internet the u s ncbinational center for biotechnology information and sister organizations in europe and japan house the gene sequence in a database known as genbank along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins other organizations such as the ucscuniversity of california santa cruz and httpwww ensembl org ensembl present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it computer programs have been developed to analyse the data because the data itself is difficult to interpret without them the process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in raw dna sequence is called genome annotation and is the domain of bioinformatics while expert biologists make the best annotators their work proceeds slowly and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the highthroughput demands of genome sequencing projects the best current technologies for annotation make use of statistical models that take advantage of parallels between dna sequences and human language using concepts from computer science such as formal grammars all humans have unique gene sequences therefore the data published by the hgp does not represent the exact sequence of each and every individuals genome it is the combined genome of a small number of anonymous donors the hgp genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences between individuals most of the current effort in identifying differences between individuals involves single nucleotide polymorphisms keuntungan keuntungan praktikal proyek projek selesai perusahaan myriad genetics menawarkan tes genetik murah mudah menunjukan gejala penyakit kanker payudara blood clotting cystic fibrosis liver there are also many tangible benefits for biological scientists for example a researcher investigating a certain form of cancer may have narrowed down his search to a particular gene by visiting the human genome database on the worldwide web this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene including potentially its threedimensional structure its functions its evolutionary relationships to other human genes or to genes in mice or yeast or fruitflies possible detrimental mutations interactions with other genes body tissues in which this gene is activated diseases associated with this gene the list of datatypes is long one reason why bioinformatics is so challenging the work on interpretation of genome data is still in its initial stages in the future the knowledge gained by the understanding of the genome will boost the fields of medicine and biotechnology eventually leading to cures for cancer alzheimers disease and other diseases on a more philosophical level the analysis of similarities between dna sequences from different organisms is opening new avenues in the study of the theory of evolution in many cases evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of molecular biology indeed many major evolutionary milestones the emergence of the ribosome and organelles the development of embryos with body plans the vertebrate immune system can be related to the molecular level many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives the primates and indeed the other mammals are expected to be illuminated by the data from this project lihat genetika bioinformatika referensi fnb1
