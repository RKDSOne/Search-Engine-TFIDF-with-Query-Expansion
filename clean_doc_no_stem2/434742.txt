phptitleusertalkjimbowalesoldid466195593 discussing whether to stage a protest against the proposed stop online piracy act sopa ive been asked to give some comments on the bill and explain what effect the proposed legislation might have on a free and open internet as well as wikipedia my goal in this blog post is to provide some information and interpretation that i hope will be helpful to wikipedia editors as they discuss the bill sopa has earned the dubious honor of facilitating internet censorship in the name of fighting online infringement the wikimedia foundation httpblog wikimedia org20111115wikimediasupportsamericancensorshipday opposed that legislation but we should be clear that wikimedia has an equally strong commitment against copyright violations the wikimedia community which has developed an unparalleled expertise in intellectual property law spends untold hours ensuring that our sites are free of infringing content in a community that embraces freelylicensed information there is no room for wikipediacopyrightviolationscopyright abuses we cannot battle however one wrong while inflicting another sopa represents the flawed proposition that censorship is an acceptable tool to protect rights owners private interests in particular media that is sopa would block entire foreign websites in the united states as a response to remove from sight select infringing material this is so even when other programs like the digital millennium copyright act have found better balances without the use of such a bludgeon for this reason we applaud the excellent work of a number of likeminded organizations that are leading the charge against this legislation including the eff orgdeeplinks201110sopahollywoodfinallygetschancebreakinternet electronic frontier

httpwww govtrack uscongressbill xpdbillh1123261 here in honesty this new version of the bill is better and credit goes to the judiciary staff for that but it continues to suffer from the same

costly regulation on web companies and giving attorney general eric holders department of justice broad new powers to police the internet members of our community are weighing whether a protest action is appropriate i want to be very clear the wikimedia foundation believes that the decision of whether to stage a protest onwiki such as shutting down the site or putting a banner at the top is a community decision the wikimedia foundation will support editors in whatever they decide to do the purpose of this post is to provide information for editors that will aid them in their discussions ive been asked for a legal opinion and i will tell you in my view the new version of sopa remains a serious threat to freedom of expression on the internet the new version continues to undermine the dmca and federal jurisprudence that have promoted the internet as well as cooperation between copyright holders and service providers in doing so sopa creates a regime where the first step is federal litigation to block an entire site wholesale it is a far cry from a less costly legal notice under the dmca protocol to selectively take down specified infringing material the crime is the link not the copyright violation the cost is litigation not a simple notice the expenses of such litigation could well force nonprofit or lowbudget sites such as those in our free knowledge movement to simply give up on contesting orders to remove their links secs 102c3 103c2 the international sites under attack may not have the resources to challenge extraterritorial judicial proceedings in the united states even if the charges are false the new version of sopa reflects a regime where rights owners may seek to terminate advertising and payment services such as paypal for an alleged internet site dedicated to theft of u s property sec 103c2 a rights owner must seek a court order unlike the previous version sec 103b5 most rights owners are well intentioned but many are not refsee httpwww chillingeffects orgresource cgiresourceid101 providing a list of articles documenting abuses that certain rights owners have engaged in within the dmca context ref we cannot assume that litigious actions to block small sites abroad will always be motivated in good faith especially when the ability to defend is difficult although rendering it discretionary secs 102c2ae 103c2ab the new bill would still allow for serious security risks to our communications and national infrastructure the bill no longer mandates dns blocking but still allows it as an option as sherwin siy deputy legal director of public knowledge httpwww hollywoodreporter comthresqstoponlinepiracyactchrisdodd272800 explained the amendment continues to encourage dns blocking and filtering which should be concerning for internet security experts the electronic frontier foundation eff orgdeeplinks201112sopamanagere28099samendmentsorryfolksite28099sstillblacklistandstilldisaster advises that the new proposed legislation still eff orgdeeplinks201111hollywoodnewwaronsoftwarefreedomandinternetinnovation targets tools that might be used to circumvent the blacklist even though those tools are essential to human rights activists and political dissidents around the world more specifically with respect to wikimedia the new version is an improvement but in addition to the reasons listed above it remains unacceptable wikipedia arguably falls under the definition of an internet search engine refan internet search engine is defined as a service made available via the internet whose primary function is gathering and reporting in response to a user query indexed information or web sites available elsewhere on the internet sec 10115a this definition does not include services that retain a third party that is subject to service of process in the united states to gather index or report information available elsewhere on the internet sec 10115b although not conceding the point wikimedia arguably does not appear to fall under this exemption ref and for that reason a federal prosecutor could obtain a court order mandating that the wikimedia foundation remove links to specified foreign infringing sites or face at least contempt of court sanctions refsec 102c3ai to ensure compliance with orders issued under section 102 the attorney general may bring an action for injunctive relief against any internet search engine that knowingly and willfully fails to comply with the requirements of section 102c2b to compel such entity to comply with such requirements ref the definition of foreign infringing sites is broadrefgenerally speaking a foreign infringing site is any u s directed site used by users in the united states being operated in a manner that would if it were a domestic internet site subject the site to liability for criminal copyright infringement as well as other federal copyright or trade secret violations see sec 102a12 ref and could well include legitimate sites that host mostly legal content yet have other purported infringing content on their sites again many international sites may decide not to defend because of the heavy price tag allowing an unchallenged block by the government the result is that under court order wikimedia would be tasked to review millions upon millions of sourced links locate the links of the socalled foreign infringing sites and block them from our articles or other projects it costs donors money and staff resources to undertake such a tremendous task and it must be repeated every time a prosecutor delivers a court order from any federal judge in the united states on any new foreign infringing site blocking links runs against our culture of open knowledge especially when surgical solutions to fighting infringing material are available under the new bill there is one significant improvement the new version exempts u s based companies including the wikimedia foundation from being subject to a litigation regime in which rights owners could claim that our site was an internet site dedicated to theft of u s property such a damnation against wikimedia could have easily resulted in demands to cut off our fundraising payment processors the new version now exempts u s sites like ours sec 103a1aii in short though there have been some improvements with the new version sopa remains far from acceptable its definitions remain too loose and its structural approach is flawed to the core it hurts the internet taking a wholesale approach to block entire international sites and this is most troubling for sites in the open knowledge movement who probably have the least ability to defend themselves overseas the measured and focused approach of the dmca has been jettisoned wikimedia will need to endure significant burdens and expend its resources to comply with conceivably multiple orders and the bill will deprive our readers of international content information and sources
