mary as queen there are two types of statements about the queen of heaven some refer to the virgin mary as theological statements about her queenship others indicate more specifically her realm of influence of the virgin as queen of heaven queen conceived without original sin queen conceived without original sin refers to the immaculate conception of the virgin mary a long held belief which became dogma roman catholicdogma in 1854 it definitively solved the question how mary fully human and in need of redemption like everybody else was granted the fullness of gods grace from her very beginning the dogma teaches that mary the mother of god participated from before her birth in the holiness of god through his grace she did not become a goddess but being without sin the spiritual

nobody else with the fullness of her person she aided the entry of peace into this world she is also considered queen of peace because throughout her life she lived by his will and not her own peace in the catholic tradition means to do his will ref fastenrath kirchenlexikon 592ref queen of the angels in the catholic tradition as reflected in the litany of loreto angels are messengers of god angels also praise god as mother of god mary is more than a messenger and nobody praised him more than mary in her magnificat in the heavenly kingdom mary is therefore queen of the angels queen of the patriarchs in the old testament patriarchs have a exceptional relation to god abraham is even seen as father of the faith gen15 5 rom 4 hebr 11 8 in the litany of loreto god is not only the god of

mary the catholic faith states as a dogma that mary is assumed into heaven and is with jesus christ her divine son mary should be called queen not only because of her divine motherhood of jesus christ but also because god has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of eternal salvation the encyclical ad caeli reginam argues that christ as redeemer is lord and king the blessed virgin is queen because of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption by giving of her own substance by freely offering him for us by her singular desire and petition for and active interest refad caeli reginam 38ref mary was chosen mother of christ so she might become a partner in the redemption of the human race the catholic church always venerared the queen of heaven according to pius xiias from the earliest ages of the catholic church a christian people whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the queen of heaven and never has that hope wavered which they placed in the mother of the divine king jesus christ nor has that faith ever failed by which we are taught that mary the virgin mother of god reigns with a mothers solicitude over the entire world just as she is crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a queen refad caeli reginam 1ref biblical basis the title has several biblical sources mary is mother of the messianic king luke 132 says of jesus he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his father david he will rule over the house of jacob forever and his reign will be without end it is therefore held in christianity that the throne of king david has passed to jesus the biblical precedent of ancient israel is that the mother of the king becomes the queen mother since jesus is heavenly king of the lineage of david and solomon many see mary as queen mother the roman catholic church also sees mary crowned as queen in heaven in the book of revelationrevelation 12 verses 15 1 a great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head 2 she was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth 3 then another sign appeared in heaven an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads catholics interpret psalm 45 a song celebrating the kings marriage refers to the messiah to suggest in verse nine that jesus the messiah would have a queen at his right hand although mary was jesus mother she is often portrayed as that queen other views are that psalm 45 refers to the marriage of jesus to his people i e the church which is called the bride of christ theologybride of christ or that psalms 45 is simply a celebration upon the marriage of an earthly king giving thanks to god but not referring to the messiah it is also believed by those assigning a special significance to mary and believing in her annunciation that in luke 12635 of the new testament the archangel gabriel seems to praise mary although she would otherwise be inferior to him the catholic church generally reasons that the bible speaks of the mother of jesus as a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars revelation 121 orthodox and some protestants interpret this verse to be a metaphor for the christian church refkallinikos 598ref liturgy of the hoursqueen of heaven in the liturgy of the hours there are for
