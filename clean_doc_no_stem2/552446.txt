one for each upper end the metalwork is often made of beaten silver sometimes gilded the gold and silver ornaments belonging to the scroll are collectively known as kele kodesh sacred vessels and somewhat resemble the ornaments of the kohen gadol high priest the scrollhandles breastplate and crown often have little bells attached to them a yad or pointer may also be hung from the scroll since the torah itself should never be touched with the bare finger this ornamentation does not constitute worship of the sefer torah but is intended to distinguish it as sacred and holy as the living word
