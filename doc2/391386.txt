'''Potret''' adalah sebuah [[lukisan]], [[foto]], [[patung]], atau representasi seni dari seseorang, yang mana wajah atau ekspresinya adalah hal yang utama. Dimaksudkan untuk menampilkan, [[personalitas]], dan juga kadang perasaan seseorang. Untuk alasan ini, fotografi potret pada umumnya bukanlah foto spontan (''snapshot''), namun komposisi seseorang dalam kondisi diam dan dipersiapkan. Sebuah potret seringkali menampilkan seseorang yang melihat langsung ke pelukis atau fotografer, dengan tujuan yang berkaitan antara subyek dengan yang melihat potret tersebut.

==Sejarah==
Beberapa lukisan potret yang awal ditemukan bukanlah potret [[raja]] atau [[kaisar]], diantaranya [[Potret-potret mumi Fayum|potret pemakaman]] yang selamat karena iklim kering Mesir di distrik [[Fayum]]. Kemungkinan hanya ini lukisan-lukisan yang selamat dari dunia klasik, selain dari karya [[fresko]], dan banyaknya patung yang terselamatkan juga potret pada koin.

The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially [[Roman sculpture]], where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. During the 4th century, the portrait began to retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Theodosius I]] at their entries.) In the [[Europe]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] representations of individuals are mostly generalized.  True portraits of the outward appearance of individuals re-emerged in the late [[Middle Ages]], in [[tomb monument]]s, [[donor portrait]]s, miniatures in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and then [[panel painting]]s.  

[[Moche]] culture of Peru was one of the few ancient civilizations which produced portraits. These works accurately represent anatomical features in great detail. The individuals portrayed would have been recognizable without the need for other symbols or a written reference to their names. The individuals portrayed were members of the ruling elite, priests, warriors and even distinguished artisans.<ref>Donnan, Christopher B.

They were represented during several stages of their lives. The faces of gods were also depicted. To date, no portraits of women have been found. There is particular emphasis on the representation of the details of headdresses, hairstyles, body adornment and face painting. 

One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which is a painting of an unidentified woman. The world's oldest known portrait was found in 2006 in the [[Vilhonneur]] grotto near [[Angoulme]] and is thought to be 27,000 years old.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cave face 'the oldest portrait on record'|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2211142,00.html|publisher=The Times|date=5 June 2006|accessdate=2008-01-04 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sage}}</ref>

==Self-portraiture==

When the artist creates a portrait of him- or herself, it is called a ''self-portrait''. Identifiable examples become numerous in the late Middle Ages, but if the definition is extended the first was by the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]'s sculptor Bak, who carved a representation of himself and his wife Taheri c. 1365 BC. However, it seems likely that self-portraits go back to the [[Cave painting|earliest representational art]], and literature records several classical examples, now lost.

==Portrait photography==
{{main|Portrait photography}}
'''Portrait photography''' is a popular commercial industry all over the world. Many people enjoy having professionally made ''family portraits'' to hang in their homes, or special portraits to commemorate certain events, such as graduations or weddings.

Since the dawn of photography, people have made portraits. The popularity of the [[daguerreotype]] in the middle of the 19th century was due in large part to the demand for inexpensive portraiture. Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day. The style of these early works reflected the technical challenges associated with 30-second exposure times and the [[painterly]] aesthetic of the time. Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors.

As photographic techniques developed, an intrepid group of photographers took their talents out of the studio and onto battlefields, across oceans and into remote wilderness. [[William Shew]]'s ''Daguerreotype Saloon'', [[Roger Fenton]]'s ''Photographic Van'' and [[Mathew Brady]]'s ''What-is-it?'' wagon set the standards for making portraits and other photographs in the field.

==Politics==
[[File:Chairman Mao.jpg|thumb|The large portrait of [[Mao Zedong]] hanging in [[Tiananmen Square]] is a well-known example of political portraiture.]]

In [[politics]], portraits of the leader are often used as a [[symbol]] of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. In most countries it is common protocol for a portrait of the [[head of state]] to appear in important [[government]] buildings. Excessive use of a leader's portrait, such as that done of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], or [[Mao Zedong]], can be indicative of a [[personality cult]].

==Literature==
{{main|Portrait (literature)}}
In '''[[literature]]''' the term ''portrait'' refers to a written description or analysis of a person or thing. A written portrait often gives deep insight, and offers an analysis that goes far beyond the superficial. For example, American author [[Patricia Cornwell]] wrote a best-selling book titled ''[[Portrait of a Killer]]'' about the personality, background, and possible motivations of [[Jack the Ripper]], as well as the media coverage of his murders, and the subsequent police investigation of his crimes.
