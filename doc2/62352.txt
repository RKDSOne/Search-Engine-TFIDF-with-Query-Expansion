'''Stadion Drago''' ({{asalkata|Inggris|Dragon Stadium}}), secara harafiah disebut Stadion Naga ({{asalkata|Inggris|Stadium of the Dragon}}) adalah sebuah stadion sepak bola yang berlokasi di [[Porto]], [[Portugal]], yang memiliki kapasitas tempat duduk sebanyak 50.476 kursi.

Stadion ini dibangun sebagai sebuah penggantian untuk markas lama [[FC Porto]], [[Stadion Antas]] ({{asalkata|Inggris|Antas Stadium}}), dan merupakan salah satu tempat penyelenggaraan [[Kejuaraan Sepak Bola Eropa 2004]]. Stadion ini selesai pembangunannya pada 2003. Beberapa bulan setelah apa yangdiharapkan, sejak [[Februari]] [[2001]] wali kota Porto Rui Rio mengganti distribusi tanah, mengkritik rencana tersebut karena stadion ini termasuk perumahan dan perbelanjaan tingkat tinggi untuk area dan memaksa pemimpin FC Porto [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa]] untuk memberhentikan seluruh operasi bangunan, yang mana hanya dilanjutkan setelah sebuah konsesus disetujui.
<!-- As of today, the stadium, housing and shopping areas have been built, but the city has apparently let go of its interest in building the school and public gardens which were part of the plan, bringing up old arguments about the mayor's decision in [[2001]].

As requested by UEFA, the old stadium was demolished and the space used for the media during EURO 2004. In the following months, construction of the buildings that will form the new urban settlement called ''Cidade das Antas'' (City of Antas) progressively started.

Designed by [[Manuel Salgado]] and built by the Grupo Amorim, it cost 97,755,318, of which 18,430,956 was subsiized by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] taxpayers. To help underwrite costs, each stand carries one or two sponsor names, [[Energias de Portugal|edp]] for the South (''Sul'') end, [[Telecomunicaes Mveis Nacionais, SA|tmn]] and Sapo adsl in the East (''Nascente'') stand, PT and TV Cabo for the West (''Poente'') stand and finally [[Coca-Cola]] in the North (''Norte'') Stand. Away fans are placed in the left corner of the North stand, while FC Porto supporter groups (SuperDrages and Colectivo Ultras 95) are one on each top, although initially both groups were in the South stand. -->
<!-- The stadium's name is derived from the presence of a [[european dragon|dragon]] on the crest of FC Porto, which is composed of an old football under the old crest of the City of Porto. It is also the nickname of FC Porto fans. Other alternatives were considered, such as ''Estdio das Antas'' (officially, unlike the former stadium) or named after [[Artur de Sousa Pinga]], [[Pedroto|Jos Maria Pedroto]] (former players and managers) or Pinto da Costa (running president for over 20 years).

The stadium was inaugurated on [[16 November]] [[2003]] with a match against [[FC Barcelona]]. FC Porto won 2-0 with goals by [[Derlei]] and [[Hugo Almeida]]. However, due to severe turf problems, FC Porto was forced to play in the old [[Estdio das Antas]], until the turf was replanted by mid February 2004. 

The stadium further cemented its reputation as an all-round sports and entertainment venue when it hosted the Portuguese leg of [[The Rolling Stones]] 2006 world tour, fighting off competition from stadiums in Lisbon. This represents something of a coup for the city of Porto over the capital.

One of the projects for the new [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] national stadium in Maze (near [[Lisburn]], built on the grounds of the disabled [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]]) is said to be modelled after the Drago. Initially planned for 30,000 seats, in order to keep up with the original plans, it went through a 12,000 seat increase. The additional costs (around 85 million pounds) are believed to be supported by possible internationals and UEFA competition finals by the local authorities. <sup>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/4265882.stm 1]</sup> -->
