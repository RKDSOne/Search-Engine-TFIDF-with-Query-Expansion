Artikel ini berkaitan dengan '''[[hewan]]''' dalam pandangan '''[[Islam]]'''

al-Qur'an meletakkan hewan pada kedudukan yang lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan manusia dan mempunyai kecenderungan terhadap [[antroposentrisme]].<ref>Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Animal Life</ref> Walau begitu, al-Qur'an menyuruh setiap Muslim untuk memperlakukan hewan dengan rasa belas kasihan dan tidak menganiaya mereka. Hewan beserta makhluk lain dipercaya senantiasa memuji Tuhan, walau pujian ini tidak dinyatakan sebagaimana yang manusia perbuat.(e.g. lihat {{cite quran|17|44|style=ref}}).<ref name="EoR&N">Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, ''Islam, Animals, and Vegetarianism</ref>

al-Qur'an secara khusus mengizinkan daging hewan untuk dimakan (lihat {{cite quran|5|1|style=ref}}).<ref name="EoR&N"/> Walaupun sebagian para [[Sufi]] mengamalkan vegetarianisme, hingga kini, tidak ada pembicaraan serius mengenai kemungkinan tafsiran vegetarianisme.<ref name="EoR&N"/> Hewan boleh dimakan dengan syarat ia disembelih sesuai syariat yang telah ditetapkan.<ref name="die">Ghamidi (2001): [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/febislaw2y2.html The Dietary Laws]</ref> Pengecualiannya adalah [[babi]], [[bangkai]],<ref>Esposito (2002b), p.111</ref> dan hewan yang tidak [[dhabihah|disembelih]] atas nama [[Allah]].<ref name="die"/> Selain itu, hewan darat karnivora dan burung bercakar juga dilarang dimakan. Hewan laut semuanya [[halal]], namun Muslim [[Syi'ah]] hanya membenarkan hewan laut bersisik serta [[udang]]. Hewan dua alam bagaimanapun haram dimakan.

== Etika terhadap hewan ==
[[Islam]] menganggap [[hewan]] sebagai [[makhluk]] yang harus dihargai. Karenanya, Islam menetapkan [[etika]] [[manusia]] terhadap hewan yaitu<ref name="alislamu">Abu Bakr Jabir al-Jazairi (2002): [http://alislamu.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158&Itemid=5 al-Islamu]</ref>:
* Memberinya makan-minum, jika hewan-hewan tersebut lapar dan haus, karena dalil-dalil berikut: Sabda [[Rasulullah]]: ''Terhadap yang mempunyai hati yang basah terdapat [[pahala]]'', (Diriwayatkan Ahmad dan Ibnu Majah). ''Siapa tidak menyayangi, ia tidak akan disayangi'', (Muttafaq Alaih). ''Sayangilah siapa saja yang ada di [[bumi]], niscaya kalian disayangi siapa saja yang ada di [[langit]]'' (Diriwayatkan Ath-Thabrani dan Al Hakim).
* Menyayanginya, dan berbelas kasih kepadanya, karena dalil-dalil berikut: Ketika Rasulullah melihat orang-orang menjadikan [[burung]] sebagai sasaran [[anak panah]], dia bersabda: ''Allah melaknat siapa saja yang menjadikan sesuatu yang ber[[nyawa]] sebagai sasaran'', (Diriwayatkan Abu Daud dengan sanad shahih). Rasulullah melarang menahan hewan untuk dibunuh dengan sabdanya: ''Barangsiapa yang menyakiti ini (burung) dengan anaknya; kembalikan anaknya padanya'', (Diriwayatkan Muslim). Rasulullah bersabda seperti itu, karena melihat burung terbang mencari anak-anaknya yang diambil salah seorang sahabat dari sarangnya.
* Jika ia ingin menyembelihnya, atau membunuhnya, maka ia melakukannya dengan baik, karena Rasulullah bersabda: ''Sesungguhnya Allah mewajibkan berbuat baik kepada segala hal. Oleh karena itu, jika kalian membunuh, maka bunuhlah dengan baik. Jika kalian menyembelih, maka sembelihlah dengan baik. Hendaklah salah seorang dan kalian menenangkan hewan yang akan disembelihnya, dan menajamkan pisaunya'', (Diriwayatkan Muslim, At Tirmidzi, An-Nasai, Abu Daud, dan Ahmad).
* Tidak menyiksanya dengan cara-cara penyiksaan apapun baik dengan melaparkannya, atau meletakkan padanya muatan yang tidak mampu ia angkut, atau membakarnya dengan [[api]], karena dalil-dalil berikut: Rasulullah saw. bersabda, ''Seorang [[wanita]] masuk neraka karena [[kucing]]. Ia menahannya hingga mati. Ia masuk neraka karenanya, karena ia tidak memberinya makan sebab ia menahannya, dan tidak membiarkannya makan serangga-serangga tanah'', (Diriwayatkan Al-Bukhari). Rasulullah berjalan melewati rumah [[semut]] yang terbakar, kemudian dia bersabda, ''Sesungguhnya siapa pun tidak pantas menyiksa dengan api, kecuali pemilik api itu sendiri (Allah)'', (Diriwayatkan Abu Daud. Hadits ini Shahih).
* Diperbolehkan membunuh hewan-hewan yang membahayakan, seperti [[anjing]] penggigit, [[serigala]], [[ular]], [[kalajengking]], [[tikus]], dan lain sebagainya, karena dalil-dalil berikut: Sabda Rasulullah, ''Ada lima hewan membahayakan yang boleh dibunuh di tempat halal dan haram, yaitu ular, burung gagak yang berwarna belang-belang, tikus, anjing yang suka menggigit dan burung hudaya (rajawali).'' (Diriwayatkan Muslim). Diriwayatkan pula bahwa diperbolehkan membunuh [[gagak]] dan melaknatnya. Diperintahkan pula untuk membunuh [[cicak]] di manapun kita jumpai.<ref>Tafsir Imam ibn Katsir juz 3 hal.185, Tafsir Imam Attabari Juz 17 hal 45.</ref><ref>Hadits shahih [[Imam Muslim]] no.2238.</ref> Muhammad bersabda ''Barangsiapa yg membunuh cecak dg satu pukulan maka baginya 100 pahala, dan bila dg dua pukulan maka terus berkurang dan berkurang.''<ref>Hadits shahih muslim no.2240.</ref> Ummu Syarik berkata: ''Nabi telah menyuruh membunuh cecak''.<ref>Hadits riwayat [[Imam Bukhari]]-[[Imam Muslim]] no.1443 (hal.792).</ref> Muhammad memberinya julukan ''Fuwaisiqa'' yang berarti si kecil yang [[fasiq]].<ref>[http://kebuli.blogspot.com/2008/05/hukum-membunuh-cecak.html Hukum membunuh cecak.]</ref>
* Diperbolehkan mengecap telinga hewan untuk kemaslahatan, karena Rasulullah mengecap [[onta]] [[zakat]] dengan tangannya yang suci.
* Mengetahui hak Allah dengan mengeluarkan zakat hewan tersebut, jika hewan tersebut termasuk hewan yang harus dizakati.
* Sibuk dengannya tidak membuatnya lupa taat kepada Allah dan lalai tidak zikir kepada-Nya, karena dalil-dalil berikut: Allah berfirman, ''Hai orang-orang yang beriman, janganlah harta-harta kalian dan anak-anak kalian melalaikan kalian dalam mengingat [[Allah]]'', (QS. [[Surah Al-Munafiqun|al-Munafiqun]]: 9). Rasulullah bersabda tentang kuda, ''Kuda terbagi ke dalam tiga jenis, seseorang mendapatkan pahala (karenanya), seseorang mendapat pakaian (karenanya), dan seseorang mendapat dosa (karenanya). Adapun orang yang mendapatkan pahala karena kuda ialah orang yang mengikatnya di jalan Allah dan memperpanjang talinya di tanah lapang, atau padang rumput. Maka apa saja yang terjadi pada kuda tersebut di tanah lapang, atau padang rumput, maka orang tersebut mendapatkan kebaikan kebaikan. Jika orang tersebut memutus talinya, kemudian kuda tersebut berjalan cepat satu langkah, atau dua langkah, maka jejak-jejaknya, dan kotoran-kotorannya adalah kebaikan-kebaikan baginya, serta [[kuda]] tersebut bagi orang tersebut adalah [[pahala]]. Orang satunya mengikatnya karena ingin memperkaya diri namun ia tidak lupa hak Allah di leher, dan tulang punggung kudanya, maka kuda tersebut adalah pakaian untuknya. Sedang orang satunya mengikatnya untuk [[sombong]], [[riya']], dan [[permusuhan]], maka kuda tersebut adalah dosa baginya'', (Diriwayatkan Al-Bukhari).

==Animals in the pre-Islamic Arabia ==
Arab bedouin, like other people, attributed the qualities and the faults of humans to animals (e.g. generosity was attributed to the cock, perfidy to the lizard, stupidity to the bustard and boldness to the lion). <ref name="Hayawan"/>

Based on the facts that the name of certain tribes bear the names of animals, survivals of animal cults, prohibitions of certain foods and other indications, W. R. Smith argued for practice of [[totemism]] by certain tribes of Arabia. Others have argued that these evidences may only imply practice of a form of [[animalism]]. In support of this, for example, it was believed that upon one's death, the soul departs from the body in the form of a bird (usually a sort of owl). The soul flys for some time around the tomb and on occasion crys out for vengeance. Although Muhammad rejected this belief it lived under Islam in various forms. <ref name="Hayawan"/>

==Qur'an==
Although over two hundred verses in the Qur'an deal with animals and six [[sura]]s (chapters) of the Qur'an are named after the animals, animal life is not a predominant theme in the Qur'an. <ref name="AnimalLife"> Animal life, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an </ref> The Arabic term for the "animal" (i.e. ''haywan'') in its only one appearance in the Qur'an means "the true life" and refers to the life in the next world rather than to "animal".<ref name="Hayawan">Hayawn, Encyclopedia of Islam </ref><ref name="AnimalLife"/> On the other hand, the Qur'an uses the term ''dbba'' which is not typically used in medieval Arabic works on zoology. However, animals are not a major theme of the Qur'an, nor are they described in detail. Animals are usually seen in relation to humans. This has created a tendency towards anthropocentrism.<ref name="AnimalLife"/>

The Qur'an explicitly allows the eating of the meat of the animals (see {{cite quran|5|1|style=ref}}).<ref name="EoR&N"/> Although some [[Sufi]]s have practiced vegetarianism, but to date, there has been no serious discourse on the possibility of vegetarianism interpretations.<ref name="EoR&N"/>

The Qur'an applies the word "Muslim" not only to humans but also to animals and the inanimate world. "The divine will manifests itself in the form of laws both in human society and in the world of nature. In Islamic terminology, for example, a bee is a Muslim precisely because it lives and dies obeying the "shariah" that God has prescribed for the community of bees, just as a person is a Muslim by virtue of the fact that he or she submits to the revealed [[shariah]] ordained for humans in the Quran and Sunna.<ref> Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, ''Islam'',p.464 </ref>

Although the Qur'an considers humans to occupy the highest place, it nevertheless strongly enjoins Muslims to treat animals with compassion and not to abuse them. The Qur'an states that all creation praises God, even if this praise is not expressed in human language (e.g. see {{cite quran|17|44|style=ref}}).<ref name="EoR&N"> Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, ''Islam, Animals, and Vegetarianism </ref> In verse {{cite quran|6|38|style=ref}}, the Qur'an applies the term "''[[ummah]]''", generally used to mean "a human religious community", for genera of animals. [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]] states that this verse have been "far reaching in its moral and ecological implications."<ref> [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Community and Society and Qur'an'', Vol. 1, p.371</ref>
<blockquote>There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end. {{cite quran|6|38|style=ref}}
</blockquote>

==Sunnah==
[[Sunnah]] refer to the traditional biographies of Muhammad wherein the example of his conduct and sayings attributed to him have been recorded. Sunni and Shi'a hadith differ vastly, with Shi'a hadith generally contain more anthropomorphism and praise of animals.

=== Treatment of animals ===
Orang Islam dilarang mengurung haiwan dalam sangkat kecil, to beat them unnecessarily, to brand them on the face, or to allow them to fight each other for human entertainment. "They must not be mutilated while they are alive."<ref name="Forw"/>

He is also reported to have said: "There is no man who kills [even] a [[sparrow]] or anything smaller, without its deserving it, but Allah will question him about it [on the judgment day]," and "Whoever is kind to the creatures of God is kind to himself."<ref name="EoR&N"/><ref name="EoIW"> [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Haywan article, p.308, vol.3, p.308</ref>

A [[Hadith]] is reported from Muhammad that he issued advice to kill the sinful (''[[Fasiq|fawasiq]]'') animal within the holy area (''[[haram]]'') of [[Mecca]], such as the rat and the scorpion. Killing animals that are non-domesticated such as zebras and birds in this area is forbidden.<ref>Jrgen Wasim Frembgen, Vlkerkundemuseum. "The Scorpion in Muslim Folklore". Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 63, 2004: 95-123. Munich, Germany.</ref>

=== Views regarding particular animals ===
==== Birds ====
[[Berkas:Green Peafowl Male.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A [[peacock]]]]
Birds in [[Islamic literature]] are commonly used and revered, especially in [[Sufi]] tradition where they are a metaphor for the soul's divine journey to God, such as in [[The Conference of the Birds]]. In the [[Shi'a]] book of hadith, [[Nahj al-Balagha]], an entire sermon is dedicated to praising [[peacocks]]. <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=zQjKHj0vA1IC&pg=PA333&lpg=PA333&dq=nahjul'balagha+peacock&source=web&ots=AyG4YZBblI&sig=FHUnF72gCdDKIiypQ0WQSJ-r3dQ&hl=en#PPA334,M1</ref>

====Dogs ====
[[Berkas:Shikoku dog.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[dog]]]]
The majority of both Sunni and Shi'a Muslim jurists consider [[dog]]s to be ritually unclean, though jurists from the Sunni [[Maliki]] school disagree.<ref name="Fadl"/> However, outside their ritual uncleanness, Islamic [[fatwas]], or rulings, enjoin that dogs be treated kindly or else be freed. <ref>http://www.al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00694.html</ref>

Muslims generally cast dogs in a negative light because of their ritual impurity. The story of the [[Seven Sleepers|Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]] in the Qur'an (and also role of the dog in early Christianity) is one of the striking exceptions.<ref> David Gordon White, Encyclopedia of religion, ''Dog'', p.2393 </ref> Muhammad didn't like dogs according to [[Sunni]] tradition, and most practicing Muslims do not have dogs as pets.<ref name="Forw"/> It is said that angels do not enter a house which contains a dog. Though dogs are not allowed for pets, they are allowed to be kept if used for work, such as guarding your house or farm, or when used for hunting purposes.

According to a generally unaccepted Sunni tradition attributed to Muhammad, black dogs are evil, or even devils, in animal form. This report reflects the pre-Islamic Arab mythology and the vast majority of Muslim jurists viewed it to be falsely attributed to Muhammad.<ref name="Fadl">http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/dinistrandna.html Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, s.v. "Dogs in the Islamic Tradition and Nature." New York: Continuum International, forthcoming 2004. By: Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl</ref>

Another Sunni tradition attributed to Muhammad commands Muslims not trade or deal in dogs.<ref>Ahmad Ibn Shuayb al-Nisai, Sunan al-Nisai (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-Arabi, n.d.), 7: 309 (The commentaries by al-Suyuti and al-Sanadi are in the margins). Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Fath al-Bari, 4:426. All reported in El Fadl.</ref> According to El Fadl, this shows the cultural biases against dogs as a source of moral danger.<ref name="Fadl"/> However, the Hanafi scholars, the largest school of ritual law in Sunni Islam, allow all trading in dogs.

According to one story, Muhammad is said to have informed a [[prostitute]] who had seen a thirsty dog hanging about a well and given it water to drink. Allah forgave her because of that good deed. [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/056.sbt.html#004.056.673 Sahih Bukhari 4.56.673] <ref name="Forw">Susan J. Armstrong, Richard G. Botzler, ''The Animal Ethics Reader'', p.237, Routledge (UK) Press </ref>

In a tradition found in the Sunni hadith book, al-Muwatta, Muhammad states that the company of dogs voids a portion of a Muslims good deeds.<ref> Malik Ibn Anas, al-Muwatta (Egypt: al-Babi al-Halabi, n.d.), 2:969. Reported in El Fadl</ref>

Dogs, outside the ritual legal discourse, were often portrayed in the literature as a symbol of highly esteemed virtues such as self-sacrifice and loyalty or on the other hand as an oppressive instrument in the hands of despotic and unjust rulers.<ref name="Fadl"/>

The historian [[Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad's kindness to animals was remarkable for the social context of his upbringing. He cites an instance of Muhammed posting sentries to ensure that a female dog with newborn puppies was not disturbed by his army traveling to Mecca in the year 630.<ref name="WattA"> Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, Oxford University Press, 1961, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/watt.html]</ref>

====Camels, sheep, and cats====
[[Berkas:Cat03.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[cat]]]]
[[Berkas:Unsortedanimal 4.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[camel]]]]
Muhammad's [[camel]], [[Qaswa]], was very dear to him.<ref name="Reeves">Minou Reeves, Muhammad in Europe, New York University (NYU) Press, p.52 </ref> [[Cat]]s were especially loved by Muhammad, he himself is said to have had least one cat called [[Muezza]][http://muttaqun.com/cats.html]. It is said he loved cats so much that "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it."<ref name="Reeves"/>

Muhammad is reported as having reprimanded some men who were sitting idly on their camels in a marketplace, saying "either ride them or leave them alone".<ref name="EoR&N"/><ref name="EoIW"> [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Haywan article, p.308, vol.3, p.308</ref>

Muhammad prided himself in being part of a rich tradition of prophets who found their means of livelihood as being shepherds.<ref> see [[Shepherd]]</ref>

====Hyenas, bats, geckos, reptiles, and insects====
In Muslim culture and literature some animals such as [[hyena]]s, [[bat]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[snake]]s, and other reptiles as well as insects are considered to represent ugliness, danger, viciousness, and power. Sometimes, the stances on them are ambivalent.<ref>Jrgen Wasim Frembgen, Vlkerkundemuseum. "The Scorpion in Muslim Folklore". Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 63, 2004: 95-123. Munich, Germany.</ref> In Shi'a Hadith such as [[Nahj al-Balagha]], bats are praised as a miracle of nature. In Sunni [[Hadith]] literature, it is reported from Muhammad that he issued advice to kill the sinful (''[[Fasiq|fawasiq]]'') animal even within the holy area (''[[haram]]'') of [[Mecca]].<ref>Jrgen Wasim Frembgen, Vlkerkundemuseum. "The Scorpion in Muslim Folklore". Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 63, 2004: 95-123. Munich, Germany.</ref> It is reported in Sunni tradition that Muhammad commanded '''geckos''' to be killed and called them 'little noxious creatures'.<ref>Sahih Muslim; Chapter 35 Book 26, Number 5562</ref>

====Pigs====
[[Berkas:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Pig]]s]]

According to many verses of the Quran, ({{cite quran|2|173|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|6|145|style=ref}}) the consumption of [[pork]] is forbidden.<ref>Esposito (2002b), p.111</ref>

{{sectstub}}

=== Conversation with animals ===
In both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] accounts, [[Muhammad]] is said to have conversed nonchalantly with camels, birds and other species. Shi'a accounts also extend this to include the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]]. In one account, a camel is said to have come to Muhammad and complained that despite service to his owner, the animal was about to be killed. Muhammad summoned the owner and ordered the man to spare the camel.<ref>Foltz (2006), pg.22-23</ref> There are also accounts in [[Surah]] [[an-Naml]] in the Qur'an of [[Islamic view of Solomon|Solomon]] talking to ants {{cite quran|27|18}} and birds {{cite quran|27|20}}, and the [[Twelver]] and [[Ismaili]] Shi'a Imams declared that they could communicate with anything that had a soul.

=== Hunting and slaughter === 
{{main|Dhabia}}
Muslims are required to sharpen the blade when slaughtering animals.<ref name="Ves"> P. Aarne Vesilind, Alastair S. Gunn, ''Engineering, Ethics, and the Environment'', Cambridge University Press, p.301 </ref> Muhammad is reported to have said:"For [charity shown to] each creature which has a wet heart (i.e. is alive), there is a reward."<ref name="EoR&N"/> Muhammad opposed recreational hunting saying: "whoever shoots at a living creature for sport is cursed."<ref name="EoR&N"/> He is also reported to have said: "There is no man who kills [even] a sparrow or anything smaller, without its deserving it, but Allah will question him about it [on the judgment day]," and "Whoever is kind to the creatures of God, is kind to himself."<ref name="EoR&N"/><ref name="EoIW"> [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Haywan article, p.308, vol.3, p.308</ref>

==Muslim culture==
Usually in Muslim culture animals have names (one animal may be given several names), which are often interchangeable with names of people. Muslim names like ''asad'' and ''ghadanfar'' ([[Arabic]] for lion), ''shir'' and ''arslan'' ([[Persian]] and [[Turkish]] for lion, respectively) are common in the Muslim world. Prominents Muslims with animal names include: [[hamza bin abdulmuttalib]] (called "Asad Allah", God's lion), [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (called "al-baz al-ashhab", the white falcon) and [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]] of [[Sehwan]] (called "red falcon").<ref name = Schimmel>Annemarie Schimmel. ''Islam and The Wonders of Creation: The Animal Kingdom''. Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation, 2003. Pages 2-4</ref>

Islamic literature contains many stories of animals. Arabic and Persian literature boast a large number of animal fables. The most famous, ''kalilah was Dimnah'', translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in the 8th century, was also known in [[Europe]]. In the 12th century Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawadi wrote many short stories of animals. At about the same time, in north-Eastern Iran, Farid al-Din Attar composed the epic poem ''Mantiq al-Tayr'' (meaning "The Discourses of the Birds")<ref name = Schimmel>Annemarie Schimmel. ''Islam and The Wonders of Creation: The Animal Kingdom''. Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation, 2003. Pages 2-4</ref>.

==Modern debates==
The ritual method of slaughter as practiced in Islam and Judaism has been decried as inhumane by government-funded animal welfare authorities in the [[UK]] who have stated that it "causes severe suffering to animals."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,956385,00.html Halal killing may be banned | The Guardian | Guardian Unlimited]</ref><ref name="bbc">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'], BBC NEWS.</ref> Cattle require up to two minutes to bleed to death when such means are employed, according to the Chairperson of the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] Judy MacArthur Clark. She adds, "This is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn't suffer is quite ridiculous." Majid Katme of the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] disagrees, stating that "[i]t's a sudden and quick haemorrhage. A quick loss of blood pressure and the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain."<ref name="bbc"> A study done by Professor [[Wilhelm Schulze (professor of veterinary medicine)|Wilhelm Schulze]] ''et al''. at the
[[University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover|University of Veterinary Medicine]] in Germany concluded that "[t]he slaughter in the form of ritual cut is, if carried out properly, painless in sheep and calves according to the [[EEG|EEG recordings]] and the missing defensive actions."<ref name="schulze_halastudy">Schulze W, Schultze-Petzold H, Hazem AS, Gross R. ''Experiments for the objectification of pain and consciousness during conventional (captive bolt stunning) and religiously mandated (ritual cutting) slaughter procedures for sheep and calves.'' Deutsche Tierrztliche Wochenschrift 1978 Feb 5;85(2):62-6. [http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/halalstudy.htm English translation by Dr Sahib M. Bleher]</ref> This study is cited by the [[German Constitutional Court]] in its permitting of dhabiha slaughtering.<ref>[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20020115_1bvr178399en.html Das Bundesverfassungsgericht]</ref> Muslims and Jews have also argued that the in the traditional British methods of slaughter, "animals are sometimes rendered physically immobile, although with full consciousness and sensation. The application of a sharp knife in shechita and dhabh, by contrast, ensures that no pain is felt: the wound inflicted is clean, and the loss of blood causes the animal to lose consciousness within seconds."<ref> Gerald Parsons, ''The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945'', Routledge Press, p.69</ref>
