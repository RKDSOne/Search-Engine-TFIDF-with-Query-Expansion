Schneider quit ''All That'' after the first four seasons to run ''The Amanda Show''. The show's ratings soon declined, and it was cancelled in the 20002001 season. Nickelodeon then asked Schneider to come back and revamp ''All That'' in 2001. Schneider agreed, and ''All That'' returned to Nickelodeon in 2002. It ran for another four seasons until 2005, bringing ''All That'' to the end of its 10-season run.
