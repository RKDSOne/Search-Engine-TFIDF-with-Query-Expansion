'''Kongregasi bagi Penginjilan''' (Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione) di [[Roma]] adalah kongregasi [[Kuria Romawi]] yang bertanggung-jawab pada karya-karya misionaris dan kegiatan-kegiatan terkait di dalamnya. Kongregasi ini mungkin lebih dikenal dengan nama lamanya, Kongregasi Suci bagi Penyebaran Iman (Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide).
 
Kongregasi ini didirikan oleh [[Paus Gregorius XV]] pada tahun 1622 sebagai Kongregasi ''Propaganda Fide'', sebuah organisasi yang mengatur karya-karya misionaris atas nama berbagai institusi keagamaan dan pada tahun 1627, [[Paus Urbanus VIII]] membentuk sebuah sekolah pelatihan bagi misionaris. Kongregasi ini diganti namanya oleh [[Paus Yohanes Paulus II]] pada tahun 1982 dan misi-misinya terus berlanjut tanpa pernah terputus.

Kantor pusat kongregasi ini mulanya berada di Palazzo Ferratini, yang disumbangkan oleh Juan Bautista Vives, berada di sebelah selatan [[Piazza di Spagna]]. Dua tokoh seni [[Barok]] terkenal dari kota [[Roma]] terlibat dalam pengembangan kompleks arsitektur bangunan ini; pematung dan arsitek [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] dan arsitek [[Francesco Borromini]].

Prefek-nya saat ini adalah Uskup Agung Fernando Filoni, sekretarisnya Uskup Agung Savio Hon Tai-Fai dari [[Hong Kong]]. Pejabat Arsip Kongregasi ini adalah Uskup Luis Manuel Cua Ramos.

==Architecture==

The Congregation was originally housed in a small palace, the Palazzo Ferratini, donated by Vives, a Spanish priest, at the southern end of the Piazza di Spagna. The architectural complex of the Propoaganda Fide was developed in the triangular urban block between the Via Due Macelli and the Via del Collegio di Propaganda Fide, two streets which diverged from the piazza.

In 1634 a small oval chapel was built according to designs by Bernini. In 1642, Father Valerio, with Bernini, redesigned the faade to the Piazza di Spagna, and the development was continued along the Via Due Macelli by [[Gaspare deVecchio]] from 1639-1645. <ref> Blunt, A. ''Guide to Baroque Rome'', Granada, 1982, 246</ref>

In 1648, Borromini took over and made various proposals that included demolishing Berninis chapel which must have been particularly galling for the latter as he could see the building from his house on Via Mercede. <ref> Blunt, 1982, 166</ref> Initially Borromini designed an elongated oval chapel plan but this was superseded by a rectilinear design, with the greater length parallel to the street, and with curved corners on the interior. Construction of the chapel commenced in 1660 and although the main part was built by 1665, some of the decoration was carried out after his death. <ref> Magnuson, T. ''Rome in the Age of Bernini'', Vol 2, 206-7</ref>

The Re Magi chapel, dedicated to the [[Three Kings]], has a plan with four side chapels and galleries above.  On the interior, the wall and the vault are differentiated horizontally by a [[cornice]] line but there is a vertical continuity of wall and vault which allows for windows at the base of the vault. The wall [[pilaster]]s are continued in the vault as ribs that criss-cross and unite the space, unlike his design at the Oratory of Philip Neri ''[[Oratorio dei Filippini]]'' where the ribs are interrupted  by the oval fresco at the centre of the vault. The criss cross arrangement in the Re Magi Chapel is such that an octagon is formed at the centre, embellished with a Dove of the Holy Spirit bathed in golden rays.

His first designs for the faade onto the Via di Propaganda Fide had five bays but he expanded this to seven. The faade is dominated by the giant pilasters that originally supported a balustrade above the narrow [[entablature]] but later extensions obliterated the balustrade. The central bay of the faade is a concave curve with angled pies at its edges, perhaps in recognition that this faade would always be seen at an oblique angle because of the narrowness of the street. The central door leads into the courtyard where Borromini intended a curved arcade but this was not built. <ref>Blunt, 1979, 246</ref> Only the left hand side of the faade relates to the chapel and the right to the stair and entrance to the College. 

Other parts of the College have further minor works by Borromini.

==History==

[[Image:L-2360-a 0008 1 t24-C-R0072.jpg|thumb|[[Alexandre de Rhodes]]' ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]'', published by the ''Propaganda Fide'' in 1651.]]
Founded in 1622 by [[Pope Gregory XV]]'s bull ''Inscrutabili Divinae'', the body was charged with fostering the spread of Catholicism and with the regulation of Catholic ecclesiastical affairs in non-Catholic countries. The intrinsic importance of its duties and the extraordinary extent of its authority and of the territory under its jurisdiction caused the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Prefect of Propaganda to be known as the "red pope".

At the time of its inception, the expansion of [[Colonialism|colonial]] administrations was coming to be largely in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[England|English]] hands, both [[Protestant]] countries intent on spreading these religious doctrines, and Rome perceived the very real threat of Protestantism spreading in the wake of commercial empire.  By 1648, with the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the official religious balance of established Christianity in Europe was permanently stabilized, but new fields for evangelization were offered by vast regions of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]] then being explored.

There had already been a less formally instituted cardinal committee concerned with ''propaganda fide'' since the time of [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (15721585), who were especially charged with promoting the union with Rome of the long-established eastern Christian communities: [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Egyptians]], and [[Abyssinians]]. This was the traditional direction for the Catholic Church to look for evangelizing. [[Catechism]]s were printed in many languages and seminarians sent to places as far as [[Malabar]]. The most concrete result was the union with Rome of the [[Ruthenia]]n Catholic communion, most concentrated in modern day [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]; the union was [[Union of Brest|formalized at Brest]] in 1508.

The death of [[Pope Gregory XV|Gregory XV]] the following year did not interrupt the organization, because Cardinal Barberini, one of the original thirteen members of the congregation, became the next pope as [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (16231644). Under Urban VIII, a central seminary (the ''Collegium urbanum'') was set up for training missionaries. The Congregation also operated the polyglot printing press in Rome, printing catechisms in many languages.  Their procurators were especially active in [[China]] from 1705, moving between [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]] before finally settling in [[Hong Kong]] in 1842.

In strongly Protestant areas, the operations of the Congregation were considered subversive: the first missionary to be killed was in [[Grisons]], [[Switzerland]], in April 1622, before the papal bull authorizing its creation had been disseminated. In [[Ireland]] after [[Catholic emancipation]] (1829), while the established church was still the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]], the Irish Catholic church came under the control of the Congregation in 1833, and soon reformed itself with a devotional revolution under [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Cardinal Cullen]]. 

These "Cardinals in General Congregation" met weekly, keeping their records in [[Latin]] until 1657, then in [[Italian language|Italian]]. The minutes are available in microfilm (filling 84 reels) at large libraries. In the course of their work, the ''Propaganda fide'' missionaries accumulated the objects now in the [[Vatican Museum]]'s Ethnological Missionary Museum.

Since 1989 the incumbent Prefect is also President of the [[Interdicasterial Commission for Consecrated Religious]].
