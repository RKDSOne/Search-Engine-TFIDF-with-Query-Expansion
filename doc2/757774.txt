'''Manchester Museum''' adalah sebuah museum yang memajang karya-karya arkeologi, antropologi dan sejarah alam, yang dimiliki oleh [[University of Manchester]]. Bertempat di [[:en:Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] ([[:en:A34 road (England)|A34]]) di jantung kelompok bangunan [[:en:Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] universitas itu, museum ini menyediakan akses bagi sekitar 4,5 juta barang dari setiap benua. Merupakan museum universitas terbesar di [[Britania Raya]] yang menjadi atraksi turis utama maupun sumber riset serta pengajaran akademis. Dikunjungi oleh sekitar 360.000 orang setiap tahunnya.
<!--
==History==
The Museum's first collections were assembled by the Manchester Society of Natural History formed in 1821 with the purchase of the collection of [[John Leigh Philips]].<ref name="MMHist">The History of the Manchester Museum, University of Manchester [http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/history/], accessed 25 November 2007</ref> In 1850 the collections of the Manchester Geological Society were added. By the 1860s both societies encountered financial difficulties and, on the advice of the evolutionary biologist [[Thomas Huxley]], [[Owens College]] (now the University of Manchester) accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The museum in Peter Street was sold in 1875 after Owens College moved to new buildings in Oxford Street.<ref>Thompson, Joseph (1886) ''The Owens College: its Foundation and Growth''. Manchester: J. E. Cornish; pp.&nbsp;28286</ref>

<!--The college commissioned [[Alfred Waterhouse]], architect of London's [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], to design a museum to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public on a site in Oxford Road (then Oxford Street). The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888. At the time, the scientific departments of the college were immediately adjacent, and students entered the galleries from their teaching rooms in the Beyer Building.<ref name="MMHist" /><ref>Charlton, H. B. (1951) ''Portrait of a University''. Manchester: U. P.; chap. V</ref>

Two subsequent extensions mirror the development of its collections. The 1912 pavilion was largely funded by [[Jesse Haworth]], a textile merchant, to house the archaeological and Egyptological collections acquired through excavations he had supported. The 1927 extension was built to house the ethnographic collections. The [[Gothic Revival]] street frontage which continues to the [[Whitworth Hall]] has been ingeniously integrated by three generations of the Waterhouse family. When the adjacent [[University Dental Hospital of Manchester]] moved to a new site, its old building was used for teaching and subsequently occupied by the museum.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartwell |first1=Clare | authorlink = |author2=Hyde, Matthew, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, Nikolaus]] | title =The Buildings of England: Lancashire: Manchester and the South-East |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2004 | location =New Haven | pages =428429 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-300-10583-5 }}</ref>

==Mission and vision==
Manchester Museum uses its international collection of human and natural history for enjoyment and inspiration, working with people from all backgrounds to provoke debate and reflection about the past, present and future of the earth and its inhabitants. Its vision is to encourage people to engage with some of the major issues of our time, to promote understanding between cultures and increase mutual understanding by placing them in context, and promote understanding of cultures of the past. Through its collections of natural and human-made objects, the museum aims to engage people in understanding climate change and habitat loss.

The Museum is one of the University of Manchester's 'cultural assets', along with the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], [[John Rylands Library]], [[Jodrell Bank]] visitor centre and others. It has a key role in delivering the university's social responsibility agenda.

==Galleries and redevelopment==
In 1997 the museum was awarded 12.5 million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and with funding from the [[European Regional Development Fund]], the University of Manchester, the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Wolfson Foundation]] and other sponsors, the museum was refurbished and reopened in 2003. The Fossils Gallery and Living Cultures Galleries were developed at this time.

The Manchester Gallery explores the changing relationship between the museum, Manchester and the rest of the world. It explores where collections came from and how they relate to colonialism and empire.

Living Worlds opened in April 2011 as a new type of natural history gallery to encourage visitors to reflect on their attitudes to nature. The gallery was designed by Brussels-based design firm villa eugenie. Exhibits include a mounted Demoiselle Crane with a piece of rubble from the [[Hiroshima]] atomic bomb blast and hundreds of origami cranes. Themed exhibits explore attitudes to nature and environmental issues. The gallery has a smartphone app, 'Living Worlds'. This gallery has an allotment in the courtyard in front of the museum, where volunteers grow fruit and vegetables and show visitors how to grow and look after plants.

Ancient Worlds opened in October 2012 and transformed the main galleries of the 1912 building. Discovering Archaeology explores how people make sense of the past using objects and includes exhibits on facial reconstruction and some of the characters who were involved in the development of archaeology and the museum, including [[William Flinders Petrie]] and [[William Boyd Dawkins]]. Egyptian Worlds, takes visitors on a journey through the landscape, customs and practices of the Ancient Egyptians. Exploring Objects, reveals the archaeology collections through '[[visible storage]]' with a difference. The gallery incorporates a [[haptic]] interactive.

Nature's Library opened in April 2013 displaying the  museum's range of natural history, using a design inspired by a Gothic library to capitalise on the gallery's [[Gothic Revival]] architecture. Displays explore the variety of the natural world, where the collection came from, why people collect specimens, how they are used, and what they can tell scientists.

In 2004 the museum acquired a reproduction cast of a fossil ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' which is mounted in a running posture.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2004/11/02/stan_dinosaur_facts_feature.shtml Stan the T-Rex facts, BBC, 2004-11-03]</ref> "Stan", as it is called, is based on the second most complete T. rex excavated in 1992 in [[South Dakota]], by Stan Sacrison.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Alchemy was a project initiating and facilitating artists' access to the museum and university. Funded by Arts Council England it offered four Alchemy Artist Fellowships, curated artist interventions in the permanent galleries and facilitated research and the loan of the museum's collections for contemporary art projects. Alchemy was the museum's first such sustained research programme. It aimed to reinvigorate displays, encourage diverse approaches and present alternative voices.

In August 2007, a temporary exhibition ''Myths About Race'' was opened.<ref>Revealing Histories: ''Myths About Race'' press release Aug 7, 2007, University of Manchester, [http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/pressreleases/fileuploadmax10mb,121445,en.pdf]</ref> Many Victorian institutions are now viewed as having contributed to the racist thinking that justified slavery. As part of the ''Revealing Histories: Remembering Slavery'' project, it explored difficult and sensitive issues. 

[[Lindow Man]] was on display for a year from April 2008 after being exhibited at the [[British Museum]].<ref>[http://www.culture24.org.uk/places+to+go/north+west/manchester/art44192 Manchester Prepares for the Appearance of Lindow Man] Culture24, February 2007, accessed 24 November 2009</ref>

== Koleksi ==

===Antropologi===
Koleksinya berjumlah sekitar 16.000 artefak, hampir separuhnya dari Afrika.<!-- Material from Oceania makes up a quarter and much of the remainder comes from Asia and the Americas. The first large donation came from Robert Dukinfield Darbishire (18261908), beginning in 1904/05. Darbishire gave about 700 items, including ceramics from Peru and Eskimo carvings. In 1922, Charles Heape donated his Oceanian and American collection amounting to about 1500 items. It included a collection of weapons and paddles from the Pacific islands, collected by missionaries and others, though some  items from the Aborigines of Victoria were acquired while Heape was resident. The Lloyd collection of Japanese metalwork, carvings and ceramics were the bequest of R. W. Lloyd. There are two collections obtained in the field by professional anthropologists. Frank Willett collected pottery, masks and ritual regalia in Nigeria in 1956 and Peter Worsley collected basketry and other items from the Wanindiljaugwa people of [[Groote Eylandt]], Australia in 1952.--><ref>''The Manchester Museum''.

===Arkeologi===
[[file:Pepi II Koptos 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Pahatan [[Pepi II]] dari kuil [[Menes]] dan [[Isis]] di [[Qift]], bagian dari koleksi Egyptological museum Manchester.]]
Area pengumpulan koleksi utama dalam arkeologi adalah Eropa Barat, [[Laut Tengah]], [[Mesir]] dan [[Asia]] Barat.<!-- Large accessions of material from Egypt and Western Asia came from the excavations of Sir [[Flinders Petrie]] and subsequently archaeologists from the university have been involved in expeditions to Western Asia and brought more finds. The Egyptological collections include finds from [[Kahun]] and [[Gurob]], presented in 1890 by [[Jesse Haworth]] and [[Martyn Kennard]]. By 1912 the growth of this area had been so great that a new wing was added for the Egyptian material to which Jesse Haworth made a major donation of funds. The Egyptian Mummy Research Project, begun in 1973, has yielded much information on health and social conditions in ancient Egypt and radiology and endoscopy have been used extensively. A redesign of the galleries in 1984/85 resulted in improved displays.<ref>''The Manchester Museum'' (1985)</ref> The archaeology collections were redisplayed in 2011 in the Ancient Worlds galleries. A [[bog body]], [[Chat Moss#Worsley Man|Worsley Man]], is also in the care of the museum.<ref>{{citation |last=Pain |first=Stephanie |title=The Head from Worsley Moss |journal=New Scientist |issue=2414 |date=23 September 2003 |issn=0262-4079}}</ref> [[Lindow Man]], another bog body had previously been displayed.--><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/ |title=British Archaeological Awards |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref>
