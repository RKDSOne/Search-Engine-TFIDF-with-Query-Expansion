'''Zulfiqar/Zulfikar Ali Bhutto''' (atau [[Shaheed]] '''Quaid-e-Awam''') ([[Urdu]]:   ) ([[Sindhi]]:   ) {{lahirmati|[[Larkana]] (di daerah [[Sindhi]], [[India]] yang kini wilayah [[Pakistan]]|5|1|1928||4|4|1979}}) adalah [[politikus]] [[Pakistan]] yang pernah menjabat sebagai [[Presiden Pakistan|Presiden]] Pakistan pada periode [[1971]] - [[1973]] dan sebagai [[Perdana Menteri Pakistan|Perdana Menteri]] Pakistan ([[1973]]-[[1977]]). Zulfikar Ali Bhutto adalah anak dari Sir [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], seorang tuan tanah [[suku Sindhi|Sindhi]] yang berpengaruh dan [[Dewan]] (menteri) untuk negara bagian [[Junagadh]]. Ia menonjol karena sebagai seorang sipil ia pernah menjadi Kepala Administratur Undang-undang Darurat selama beberapa minggu. Ia digulingkan dalam sebuah kudeta oleh Jenderal [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], dan dihukum [[hukuman gantung|gantung]] pada [[1979]] oleh Mahkamah Agung di bawah undang-undang darurat atas tuduhan memberikan wewenang atas [[pembunuhan]] terhadap seorang lawan politik. 

== Biografi ==
=== Tahun-tahun awal ===
Bhutto dilahirkan di [[Larkana]] (di daerah [[Sindhi]] yang kini wilayah Pakistan) sebagai anak dari [[Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto]]. Ia menyelesaikan pendidikan awalnya di [[Mumbai]] di [[Cathedral and John Connon School]]. Setelah menyelesaikan pendidikan dasar dan menengahnya, ia pergi ke [[Amerika Serikat]] pada 1947 untuk belajar di [[Universitas Southern California]], dan belakangan pindah ke [[Universitas California, Berkeley]]. Ia mendaftar ke Harvard dan diterima, tetapi ia memilih untuk tinggal di Berkeley. Ia menjadi mahasiswa Asia pertama yang terpilih menjadi anggota Dewan Mahasiswa Berkeley. Dari Berkeley ia memperoleh gelar [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] dalm ilmu politik pada 1950, dan sesudah itu ia pergi ke [[Universitas Oxford|Oxford]] dan belajar di [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] dan lulus dengan ''honors''. 

Setelah dari Oxford, ia dipanggil untuk masuk ke perhimpunan ahli hukum di [[Lincoln's Inn]] pada 1953 (yang juga pernah dimasuki oleh [[Allama Iqbal]] dan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]). Tahun yang sama istrinya Begum [[Nusrat Bhutto]] melahirkan anak perempuan [[Benazir Bhutto|Benazir]], yang belakangan juga menjadi perdana menteri. 

=== Karier politik ===
Pada masa-masa mahasiswanya, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto mengembangkan pandangan anti imperialis tentang dunia. Ia percaya yakin akan kemandirian ekonomi dan tema-tema kemandirian politik yang diuraikannya dalam bukunya, ''[[Mitos|Myth]] of Independence''. 

Sebagai anggota delegasi Pakistan di [[PBB]] pada 1957, pada usia 29 tahun, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto berpidato pada Konferensi Keenam dari PBB tentang "Definisi Agresi". Sebagai peserta pada Konferensi Internasional di [[Jenewa]], [[Swiss]] pada Maret 1958 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto berbicara untuk umat manusia dengan pernyataan yang berani: "Samudra Bebas itu bebas untuk semua." Ia adalah anggota termuda dalam Kabinet Federal dalam sejarah Pakistan, dalam usia 30 tahun. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto memegang jabatan-jabatan kunci sebagai Menteri Perdagangan, Menteri Informasi, Menteri Rekonstruksi Nasional, Menteri Bahan Bakar, Sumber Daya dan Sumber-sumber Alam, sebelum ia menjadi Menteri Luar Negeri. Sebagai Menteri Bahan Bakar, Sumber Daya dan Sumber-sumber Alam, ia menandatangani perjanjian terobosan untuk melakukan eksplorasi minyak dan gas bersama [[Rusia]] pada 1960. Ia membentuk Perusahaan Pengembangan Gas dan Mineral pada 1961 dan penyulingan minyak pertama Pakistan pada 1962 di [[Karachi]].

<!--Bhutto emerged on the world stage as Leader of the Pakistan Delegation to the UN in 1959.  To muster the support for [[Kashmir]] issue he toured [[China]], [[Britain]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ireland]].  He also held a series of talks with the Indian Foreign Minister [[Swaran Singh]].  He was appointed Foreign Minister in 1963 and remained at that post until his resignation in June 1966. Bhutto made indelible imprints on world community by his inimitable oratorical skills in United Nation's General Assembly and the Security Council{{citation needed}}. He believed in an independent Foreign Policy which had hitherto been the hand maiden  of the Western Powers.  During his tenure as Foreign Minister, Pakistan and [[Iran]] cemented a special relationship. 

In [[1958]] he joined the cabinet of President [[Iskander Mirza]].  From this point, he was active in the Pakistani government, working at various posts. In 1966 he resigned from the cabinet, after serving as [[:Category:Foreign Ministers of Pakistan|Foreign Minister]].

His opposition to the Tashkent accord between [[India]] and Pakistan led to his resignation from the government. In [[1967]] Bhutto formed the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP) to oppose President [[Ayub Khan]]'s regime. He adopted a uniform similar to those worn by the [[Communist Party of China]] leaders and called for the introduction of "[[Islamic socialism]]" in Pakistan and the commencement of a "thousand years war" against [[India]]. The slogan of "Food, Shelter and Clothing" shifted the focus of Pakistan politics from theological to economic issues. Using the popular title '''Quaid-e-Awam''' ("Leader of the People,") Bhutto launched a nationwide tour, agitating against the military dictatorship. 

Bhutto was arrested in connection with these activities in November 1968, and detained for 3 months. The movement he helped unleash in [[West Pakistan]] (coextensive with the country's current boundaries), in conjunction with agitation for greater autonomy taking place in [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]), forced the resignation of [[Ayub Khan]] in March 1969. Ayub Khan handed power over to the army commander in chief, [[Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan]], who assumed the presidency and reimposed martial law. 

The issue of an autonomous [[East Pakistan]] continued to plague Yahya's Administration. In the elections held in 1970, the pro-autonomy [[Awami League]] won by a landslide in East Pakistan, capturing enough parliamentary seats to control any government that might be formed. On the other side, Bhutto's [[PPP]] captured the majority of seats in [[West Pakistan]]. When Bhutto delayed the transfer of power to the newly elected representatives in March 1971, public unrest erupted in [[East Pakistan]]. East Pakistani leaders demanded the establishment of an independent nation of [[Bangladesh]], and the Pakistani Army cracked down on armed revolutionaries and massacred civilians in [[East Pakistan]].

===President of Pakistan (1971  1973)===

Following a nine-month civil war between the West Pakistani army and the East Pakistani guerilla forces, India intervened in December, the Pakistani Army was swiftly defeated, and East Pakistan emerged as the state of Bangladesh ([[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]). Yahya Khan resigned, and Bhutto was inaugurated as President and Chief Martial Law Administrator on December 20, 1971. Bhutto moved for the recognition of Bangladesh, releasing Bengali leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] from Pakistani detainment after rescinding then-Brigadier [[Rahimuddin Khan]]'s military trial verdict of guilty earlier on.  
For a brief period, Bhutto appointed [[General Gul Hassan]] as the Commander-in-chief of the then demoralized Pakistani Army. However, Bhutto dismissed Gul Hassan in March 1972 and appointed General [[Tikka Khan]] as Chief of the Army Staff.

He nationalized Pakistan's major industries, life insurance companies, and private schools and colleges. Although still a major landholder, dubbed by his opponents the "Raja of Lrkna," Bhutto enacted tax relief for the countrys poorest agricultural workers and placed ceilings on land ownership.  During his tenure there was a massive transfer of resources towards the dominant rural economy by setting higher prices for agricultural products.

The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant was inaugurated by Bhutto during his role as '''President  of Pakistan''' at the end of 1972. Long before, as '''Minister for Fuel, Power and National Resources''', he has played a key role in setting up of the ''Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission''. The Kahuta facility was also established by the Bhutto Administration.

===Prime Minister of Pakistan (1973  1977)===

He helped unite the country despite worries of its imminent collapse post [[1971]], lifted martial law in [[1972]], and pushed through a new [[constitution]] in 1973 that recognized [[Islam]] as the [[national religion]]. The never ending dispute of powers between the Head of State and Parliament was resolved temporarily by empowering the office of the [[Prime Minister]]. 

On the international front, Bhutto resumed implementation of his policy of nonaligned neutrality. He withdrew Pakistan from the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and from the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] ([[SEATO]]), sponsored by the [[United States]]. In July 1972 he negotiated the Simla Agreement, which confirmed a line of control dividing Kashmr and prompted the withdrawal of Indian troops from Pakistani territory. To forge closer ties with the Islamic world, in 1974 Bhutto hosted the second meeting of the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] in the city of [[Lahore]]. He used this forum to announce Pakistans official recognition of [[Bangladesh]]. To bolster Pakistans military defense capabilities, Bhutto laid the groundwork for a nuclear weapons program.

During elections held in March 1977, nine opposition parties, united as the [[Pakistan National Alliance]], ran an apparently popular campaign against Bhuttos PPP. When the PPP won a decisive victory in the parliamentary round of the elections, the PNA accused Bhuttos party of rigging the vote and withdrew in protest from upcoming provincial elections. Widespread street fighting broke out, and opposition politicians were arrested.

As the situation deterioated Bhutto and PNA leaders started negotiations for a peaceful conclusion of the confrontation. After protracted negotiations agreement was finally agreed upon at the end of june 1977. The day after the agreement martial law was imposed by the Army.

===Downfall and trial===

On [[July 5]],[[1977]] the military, led by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], staged a coup. Zia relieved Bhutto of power, holding him in detention for a month. Zia pledged that new elections would be held in 90 days. He kept postponing the elections and publicly retorted during successive press conferences that if the elections were held in the presence of Bhutto his party would not return to power again.

Upon his release, Bhutto traveled the country amid adulatory crowds of PPP supporters.  He used to take the train traveling from the south to the north and on the way, would address public meetings at different stations.  Several of these trains were late, some by days, in reaching their respective destinations and as a result Bhutto was banned from traveling by train.  The last visit he made to the city of Multan in the province of Punjab was marked the turning point in Bhutto's political career and ultimately, his life. In spite of the administration's efforts to block the gathering, the crowd was so large that it became disorderly, providing an opportunity for the administration to declare that Bhutto had been taken into custody because the people were against him and it had become necessary to protect him from the masses for his own safety. 

On [[September 3]] the army arrested Bhutto again on charges of authorizing the murder of a political opponent in March of [[1974]]. A 35-year-old politician Ahmed Raza Kasuri tried to run as a [[PPP]] candidate in elections, despite having previously left the party. The PPP rebuffed him. Three years earlier, Kasuri and his family had been ambushed, leaving Kasuri's father, ''Nawab Mohammad Ahmad Khan'', dead. Kasuri claimed that he was the actual target, accusing Bhutto of being the mastermind. Kasuri later claimed that he had been the victim of 15 assassination attempts.

Bhutto was released 10 days after his arrest after a judge, Justice KMA Samadani found the evidence "contradictory and incomplete." Justice Samadani had to pay for this; he was immediately removed from the court and placed at the disposal of law ministry. Three days later Zia arrested Bhutto again on the same charges, this time under "martial law." When the PPP organized demonstrations among Bhutto's supporters, Zia canceled the upcoming elections.

Bhutto was arraigned before the High Court of [[Lahore]] instead of in a lower court, thus automatically depriving him of one level of appeal. The judge who had granted him bail was removed. Five new judges were appointed, headed by Chief Justice of Lahore High Court Maulvi Mustaq, who denied bail. The trial would last five months, and Bhutto appeared in court on a dock specially built for the trial.

Proceedings began on [[October 24]],[[1977]]. ''Masood Mahmood'', the director general of the Federal Security Force (since renamed the '''Federal Investigation Agency'''), testified against Bhutto. Mahmood had been arrested immediately after Zia's coup and had been imprisoned for two months prior to taking the stand. In his testimony, he claimed Bhutto had ordered Kasuri's assassination and that four members of the Federal Security Force had organized the ambush on Bhutto's orders.

The 4 alleged assassins were arrested and later confessed. They were brought into court as "co-accused" but one of them recanted his testimony, declaring that it had been extracted from him under torture. The following day, the witness was not present in court; the prosecution claimed that he had suddenly "fallen ill."

Bhutto's defense challenged the prosecution with proof from an army logbook the prosecution had submitted. It showed that the jeep allegedly driven during the attack on Kasuri was not even in Lahore at the time. The prosecution had the logbook disregarded as "incorrect." During the defense's cross-examination of witnesses, the bench often interrupted questioning. The 706-page official transcript contained none of the objections or inconsistencies in the evidence pointed out by the defense. Former U.S. attorney general [[Ramsey Clark]], who attended the trial, wrote;

:''"The prosecution's case was based entirely on several witnesses who were detained until they confessed, who changed and expanded their confessions and testimony with each reiteration, who contradicted themselves and each other, who, except for Masood Mahmood ... were relating what others said, whose testimony led to four different theories of what happened, absolutely uncorroborated by an eyewitness, direct evidence, or physical evidence."''

When Bhutto began his testimony on [[January 25]], [[1978]], Chief Justice Maulvi Mustaq closed the courtroom to all observers. Bhutto responded by refusing to say any more. Bhutto demanded a retrial, accusing the Chief Justice of bias, after Mustaq allegedly insulted Bhutto's home province. The court refused his demand.

On [[March 18]], [[1978]], Bhutto was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Bhutto did not seek an appeal. While he was transferred to a cell in [[Rawalpindi]] central jail, his family appealed on his behalf, and a hearing before the Supreme Court commenced in May. Bhutto was given one week to prepare. Bhutto issued a thorough rejoinder to the charges, although Zia blocked its publication. Chief Justice [[S. Anwarul Haq]] adjourned the court until the end of July 1978, supposedly because 5 of the 9 appeals court judges were willing to overrule the Lahore verdict. One of the pro-Bhutto judges was due to retire in July.

Chief Justice [[S. Anwarul Haq]] presided over the trial, despite being close to Zia, even serving as Acting President when Zia was out of the country. Bhutto's lawyers managed to secure Bhutto the right to conduct his own defense before the Supreme Court. On [[December 18]], [[1978]], Bhutto made his appearance in public before a packed courtroom in Rawalpindi. By this time he had been on death row for 9 months and had gone without fresh water for the previous 25 days. He addressed the court for four days, speaking without notes.

The appeal was completed on [[December 23]],[[1978]]. On [[February 6]], [[1979]], the Supreme Court issued its verdict, "Guilty", a decision reached by a bare 4-to-3 majority. The Bhutto family had 7 days in which to appeal. The court granted a stay of execution while it studied the petition. By [[February 24]],[[1979]] when the next court hearing began, appeals for clemency arrived from many heads of state. Zia said that the appeals amounted to "trade union activity" among politicians.

Before his Appeal Zia sent him a messenger to Bhutton in jail and said if he(Bhutto) asks for forgivness from Zia then he'll let him go.  In return Bhutto asked the person "Do you know my father's name" and the person said of course, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, he then asked "Do you know Zia's Father name" to which he replied No, Bhutto then said, "My Father was/is a Legend, and what about his father, why should i ask for forgivness, specially from a person who doesn't even have a father.   no one knows his Father's Name".

On [[March 24]],[[1979]] the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. Zia upheld the death sentence. On [[April 4]], [[1979]], Bhutto was hanged.

==Political legacy==
{{Wikiquote}}
The Constitution of 1973, passed unanimously, is a direct legacy of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The ''Role of Islam'' in the State, the degree of ''Provincial Autonomy'', and the ''Nature of Executive'' were points of dispute since the birth of the State.  Bhutto managed to bring all the political parties: '''Jamat-e-Islami''', '''JUI''' and '''JUP''', who demanded  an Islamic State; and [[Wali Khan]], the leader of the opposition in Parliament, led [[National Awami Party]], which was the major party in the Frontier and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], calling for autonomy, to agree to a consensus on the new Constitution and permanently  resolving all the three issues.

The '''Senate of Pakistan''' was created, in which the provinces had equal representation in order to redress the balance of power in Pakistan. The creation of '''Council of Common Interest''' also gave to the provinces a greater weight in the federal dispensation. Islam was declared to be the State religion, and the '''Council of Islamic Ideology''' was given charge of the Islamisation of laws. At the same time the Constitution reiterated  the basic principle of socialism: "[[from each according to his ability to each according to his need]]". 

Through the 13th Amendment of [[1997]], the role of the [[Prime Minister]] was restored as was intended to be according to the Constitution of 1973.  This role of the Prime Minister temporary lasted until General [[Pervez Musharraf]] took over as the Chief Executive in 1999 through a military coup d'tat.  The constitution was further mutilated through yet another LFO; Legal Framework Order, this time of another General.  The 17th amendment of December 29, 2003 rendered the role of the Prime Minister a puppet at the hands of the ruling General and the Parliament to that of ineffective rubber stamp{{fact}}. -->
