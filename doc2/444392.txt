'''Home United Football Club''' adalah klub [[sepak bola]] profesional yang bermain di [[S.League]] Singapura.

==Sejarah==
The Police Sports Association was founded in the mid-1940s to organise football activities for the Singapore Police Force. They sent two teams to compete in the Singapore Amateur Football Association League in the 1950s and 1960s, but neither team won any trophies. Under coach [[Choo Seng Quee]], the new Police Team won the inaugural President's Cup in 1968, then reached and lost the next two finals. In 1979, they joined the National Football League, were placed in Division III and immediately earned promotion to Division II. 1980 was a watershed year for the Police Team, as they won the Division II title, the President's Cup and the Boggars Cup. In 1985, they were national league champions, after setting a national record as the only team to go unbeaten for 17 consecutive games. The convincing performances of Police Football Club led to their selection as one of eight teams to compete in the newly formed S.League.<ref name="koh">Malathi Das and Palakrishnan (1996), "S.League: the kick-off", Singapore Professional Football League Pte Ltd, p. 33</ref>.

When the S.League was formed in 1996, the club was known as the '''Police Football Club'''. The following year, its name was changed to Home United to reflect that fact that the team represents not only the [[Singapore Police Force]], but also other service arms of the Singapore [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] such as the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] and the [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]].

Home United won the S.League in 1999 and 2003, and the [[Singapore Cup]] in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2005.

The team's nickname is the "Protectors", and its mascot is a dragon. The team's home ground is the [[Bishan Stadium]].
