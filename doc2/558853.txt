'''Simchat Torah''' ('''Simkhat Taurat'''; '''Simath Torah'''; juga '''Simkhes Toreh''', [[bahasa Ibrani]]:  , arti harfiah, "Bersukacita atas[/dengan] [[Taurat]]") adalah hari raya Yahudi yang memperingati dan menandai penutupan siklus tahunan [[pembacaan Taurat]] di depan umum, dan permulaan siklus yang baru. Simhat Torah merupakan komponen dari [[hari-hari raya Yahudi|hari raya]] yang diperintahkan dalam [[Alkitab Ibrani]] yaitu ''[[Shemini Atzeret]]'' ("Delapan hari pertemuan"; "''Eighth Day of Assembly''"), yang langsung mengikut festival [[Sukkot]] pada bulan [[Tisyri]] (jatuh antara pertengahan bulan September sampai awal Oktober pada [[kalender Gregorian]]).

Perayaan utama Simhat Torah dilakukan di [[sinagoga]] selama ibadah sore dan pagi. Dalam kongregasi [[Yudaisme Ortodoks]] maupun [[Yudaisme Konservatif]], ini adalah satu-satunya waktu dalam setahun di mana ''Sefer Torah'' (gulungan Taurat) dikeluarkan dari tabut tempat penyimpanannya (''ark'') dan dibaca pada ''malam hari''. Pada waktu pagi, ''[[parsyah]]'' terakhir dari [[Kitab Ulangan]] dan ''parsyah'' pertama dari [[Kitab Kejadian]] dibacakan di sinagoga. Setiap kali tabut Taurat dibuka, para hadirin dalam ibadah meninggalkan kursinya untuk menari dan menyanyi bersama gulungan Taurat dalam suasana perayaan yang gembira dan dapat berlangsung beberapa jam lamanya.

Ibadah pagi juga berciri khas dengan memanggil setiap anggota pria (dalam beberapa Ortodoks, dan dalam mayoritas non-Ortodoks, anggota pria dan wanita) dari kongregasi untuk suatu ''aliyah'' (nas bacaan; ''Baal kore''). Juga ada ''aliyah'' khusus untuk anak-anak (di bawah usia 13 tahun untuk anak laki-laki, 12 tahun untuk anak perempuan).

== Duration of holiday==

On the [[Hebrew calendar]], the 7 day holiday of [[Sukkot]] in the autumn (late mid-September to late mid-October) is immediately followed by the holiday of [[Shemini Atzeret]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside Israel, Shemini Atzeret is a two-day holiday and the Simhat Torah festivities are observed on the second day. The first day is referred to as "Shemini Atzeret" and the second day as "Simhat Torah," although both days are officially Shemini Atzeret according to [[Halakha]], and this is reflected in the liturgy.

In [[Israel]], Shemini Atzeret and Simhat Torah are celebrated on the same day. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregations, even not in Israel, may do likewise. Many communities in Israel have ''Hakafot Shniyot'' ("Second Hakafot") on the evening following the holiday, which is the same day as Simhat Torah evening in the diaspora. The custom was started by the former Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, Rabbi [[Yedidia Frankel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/148941#.UBXLUqDnEoN |title=Video: Second Round - Post Sukkot Hakafot in Urban Israel |date=October 22, 2011 |last1=Sylvetsky |first1=R. |last2=Kempinski |first2=Yoni |work=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}</ref>

==Evening festivities==

[[File:Simhat Torah 17th century.jpg|thumb|''Throwing cakes to children on Simat Torah'', by [[Johann Leusden]] in ''Philologus Hebro-Mixtus'', [[Utrecht]], 1657]]

The Simhat Torah festivities begin with the evening service. All the synagogue's Torah scrolls are removed from the [[Ark (synagogue)|ark]] and are carried around the sanctuary in a series of seven ''hakafot'' (circuits). Although each ''hakafa'' need only encompass one circuit around the synagogue, the dancing and singing with the Torah often continues much longer, and may overflow from the synagogue onto the streets.

In Orthodox and Conservative Jewish synagogues, each circuit is announced by a few melodious invocations imploring God to ''Hoshiah Na'' ("Save us") and ending with the refrain, ''Aneinu B'yom Koreinu'' ("[God] answer us on the day we call"). In Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, the ''hakafot'' are accompanied by traditional chants, including biblical and liturgical verses and songs about the Torah, the goodness of God, [[Jewish Messianiasm|Messianic]] yearnings, and prayers for the restoration of the [[Davidic line|House of David]] and the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Congregations may also sing other, popular songs during the dancing. Children are often given flags, candies and other treats. The vigour of the dancing and degree of festive merriment varies with congregational temperament.

In Orthodox synagogues, the dancing is mainly carried out by men and boys; children (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, or look on from the other side of a ''[[mechitza]]'' (partition) in accordance with the rules of ''[[tzniut]]'' (modesty). In Conservative and progressive congregations, men and women dance together. In some congregations, the Torah scrolls are carried out into the streets and the dancing may continue far into the evening.

After the ''hakafot'', many congregations recite a portion of the last ''[[parashah]]'' of the Torah, ''[[V'Zot HaBerachah]]'' ("This is the Blessing ...") in [[Deuteronomy]]. The part read is usually 33:1-34:12, but may vary by synagogue custom, although Deuteronomy is never read to the end in the evening.

==Morning festivities==

The morning service, like that of other Jewish holidays, includes a special holiday [[Amidah]], the saying of [[Hallel]], and a holiday [[Mussaf]] service. When the ark is opened to take out the Torah for the Torah reading, all the scrolls are again removed from the ark and the congregation again starts the seven ''hakafot'' just like in the evening.

===Early priestly blessing===

In many congregations, one deviation from an otherwise ordinary holiday morning service is the performance of the [[Priestly Blessing]] as part of the Shacharit service, before the celebrations connected with the Torah reading begin, rather than as part of the Musaf service that follows. This practice hearkens back to an old custom for the [[kiddush]] sponsored by the Hatan Torah (see below) to be held during the Simhat Torah service itself where hard liquor (along with other refreshments) may be served. Since the Bible prohibits [[Kohen|Kohanim]] (descendants of Aaron) from performing the priestly blessing while intoxicated, and there is concern that Kohanim may imbibe alcoholic beverages during the Simhat Torah festivities, the blessing was moved to before the time when alcohol would be served.<ref>[http://www.chaburas.org/simchatora.html SIMCHAT TORAH], Chabura-Net</ref> In some congregations, the Kohanim deliver their blessing as usual during the Musaf service of Simhat Torah. (In some congregations in Israel, the Kohanim deliver their blessing at both Shacharit and Musaf services.)

===Torah reading and customs===

After the ''hakafot'' and the dancing, three scrolls of the Torah are read. The last ''parashah'' of the [[Torah]], [[V'Zot HaBerachah]], at the end of Deuteronomy (33:1-34:12), is read from the first scroll, followed immediately by the first chapter (and part of the second) of the [[Book of Genesis]] (1:1-2:3), which is read from the second scroll. It is a Jewish custom that a new beginning must immediately follow a completion, therefore it is logical to immediately read Gen. 1 after finishing Deuteronomy.

It is a special honor to receive the last ''aliyah'' of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]; the person receiving that aliyah is called the ''Hatan Torah'' (the groom of the Torah) (or ''Kallat Torah'' (the bride of the Torah) in synagogues that allow women to receive an ''aliyah''). Likewise, it is a special honor to receive the first ''aliyah'' of the [[Book of Genesis]]; that person is called ''Hatan B'reishit'' (the groom of Genesis) (or ''Kallat B'reishit'' (the bride of Genesis)).

In many congregations it is customary to call all eligible members of the congregation for an ''[[Baal kore|aliyah]]'' to the Torah on Simhat Torah. To accommodate this the first five ''aliyot'' are reread so that everyone has an opportunity to recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate ''minyanim'' for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations women receive ''aliyot'' in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women, who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah in front of the whole congregation.

Another custom is to call all the children (in Orthodox congregations boys only) to a special ''aliyah'' called ''Kol HaNe'arim'' (all the children). In many congregations, a large [[talit]] is spread out over the heads of all the children as the blessing over the Torah is pronounced, and for the congregation to bless the children by reciting (in Hebrew) a verse from Jacob's blessing to [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]], [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 48:16.

:May the angel who redeems me from all evil bless the children, and may my name be declared among them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they teem like fish for multitude within the land.

Although the blessing of the children is omitted from the 1985 edition of Conservative Judaism's [[Siddur Sim Shalom]] prayer book, it was reinstated in later versions. Most Conservative congregations still perform it.

After the portion of Genesis is read, the [[Maftir]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 29:35-30:1, is read from a third Torah scroll. The passage describes the prescribed [[Korban|offerings]] performed for the holiday. The [[haftarah]] (reading from the prophets) is the first section of the [[Book of Joshua]].

==History==

The name ''Simhat Torah'' was not used until a relatively late time. In the [[Talmud]] ([[Megillah (Talmud)|Meg]]. 31b) it is called [[Shemini Atzeret]]. The Darchei Moshe (OC 669:3) cites a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] from [[Joseph Colon Trabotto|R' Joseph Colon]] (#26) who found a [[Geonim|Geonic]] responsa mentioning the custom of dancing on Simhat Torah, thus dating the current practice of dancing on Simhat Torah to the 1st century [[ACE]]. 

In the 9th century, some European Jewish communities assigned a special reading from the Prophets to be read on this day. In the 14th century, the reading of Genesis was added immediately upon the completion of Deuteronomy and the [[Shulchan Aruch|Shulhan Arukh]] (written about 1565)<ref>OC    see Mishnah Berurah volume 6 page 272</ref> only mentions this without mentioning the presumably later custom of southern European countries to remove all the Torah scrolls from the ark and to sing a separate hymn for each one. In northern European countries, those who had finished the reading of Deuteronomy made donations to the synagogue, after which the wealthier members of the community would give a dinner for friends and acquaintances. By the end of the 15th century, it was a common though not universal practice for the children to tear down and burn the [[sukkah]]s on Simhat Torah.<ref>Maharil, cited in OC Darchei Moshe 669:3)</ref>

In the 16th century, the practice of taking out the scrolls and filing solemnly around the [[bimah]] on the night of the 23rd of Tishri became customary; and on the same evening, after the procession, a number of passages from the Torah were read.

In the 17th century, [[Rebecca bat Meir Tiktiner]] of [[Prague]] composed a poem about Simhat Torah.

In [[Poland]] it was the custom to sell to the members of the congregation, on the 23rd of Tishri, the privilege of executing various functions during the services on Shabbat and Jewish festivals; [[ie]] the synagogue used this occasion as a fund-raiser. People who made these donations were called up to the Torah and given a congregational blessing.

== Simbol identitas Yahudi ==

Pada abad ke-20, Simhat Torah menjadi simbol pernyataan publik akan identitas Yahudi.<ref>Zenner, Walter P. Persistence and Flexibility: Anthropological Perspectives on the American Jewish Experience. [[SUNY Press]], 1988. p.85</ref> Orang Yahudi di Rusia, secara khusus, merayakan festival ini ''en masse'' (serentak keluar bersama-sama) di jalanan kota [[Moskow]]. Pada tanggal 14 Oktober 1973, lebih dari 100.000 orang Yahudi mengambil bagian dalam rally setelah Simhat Torah di kota [[New York]] demi orang-orang ''refuseniks'' dan Yahudi Rusia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sovietjewry.org/gallery_photo.php?photo=9 |title=Soviet Jewry |publisher=Soviet Jewry |date=1973-10-14 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref> Menari di jalanan dengan Taurat juga telah menjadi bagian ritual hari raya di berbagai kongregasi Yahudi di Amerika Serikat.

== Komemorasi ==

Pada tahun 1996, Dinas Pos Israel menerbitkan sebuah [[perangko]] untuk memperingati hari raya ini.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.israelphilately.org.il/stamps/stamp.asp?id=394 |title=Simchat Torah stamp |publisher=English.israelphilately.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>

== Lagu ==

Banyak lagu populer dinyanyikan pada hari Simhat Torah. Sebagai hari merayakan Taurat, lagu-lagu ini umumnya menaikkan pujian akan kebesaran Taurat dan hubungan orang Yahudi dengan Taurat. Sebagian lagu-lagu yang biasa dinyanyikan:
*''Ashrei Ha'am Shekacha Lo''
*''Toras Hashem Temima''
*''Moshe Emes Visoraso Emes''
*''Baruch Hu Elokeinu Shebaranu Lichvodo''
*''Yisroel V'oraysa V'kudsha B'rich Hu Chad Hu''
*''Ashrei Mi She'amalo Batorah'' 
*''V'af Al Pi Sheyismahmay'a''
*''Anah Avda D'kudsha B'rich Hu''
*''V'taher Libeinu L'avdacha B'emes''
*''Achas Sha'alti Mei'eis Hashem''
*''Ashreinu Mah Tov Chelkeinu''

Seringkali, pada saat Taurat dikembalikan ke dalam tabut tempat penyimpanannya, dinyanyikanlah "''S'u She'arim Rasheichem''". Ketika ''[[gabbai]]'' memanggil ''[[kohein]]'', "''Viya'azor Veyagein Veyoshia''" dinyanyikan.
