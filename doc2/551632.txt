==In classical rabbinic interpretation==
The parashah is discussed in these [[rabbi]]nic sources from the era of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]:

===Numbers chapter 1===
The Rabbis discussed why, in the words of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1,|HE}} God spoke to Moses "in wilderness."  [[Rava (amora)|Raba]] taught that when people open themselves to everyone like a wilderness, God gives them the Torah.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/nedarim/nedarim_55.html Babylonian Talmud Nedarim 55a.]</ref> Similarly, a [[Midrash]] taught that those who do not throw themselves open to all like a wilderness cannot acquire wisdom and Torah.  The Sages inferred from {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} that the Torah was given to the accompaniment of fire, water, and wilderness.  And the giving of the Torah was marked by these three features to show that as these are free to all people, so are the words of the Torah; as {{Bibleverse-lb||Isaiah|55:1|HE}} states, "everyone who thirsts, come for water."<ref>[[Numbers Rabbah]] 1:7.</ref> Another Midrash taught that if the Torah had been given to the Israelites in the [[land of Israel]], the tribe in whose territory it was given would have said that it had a prior claim to the Torah, so God gave it in the wilderness, so that all should have an equal claim to it.  Another Midrash taught that as people neither sow nor till the wilderness, so those who accept the yoke of the Torah are relieved of the yoke of earning a living; and as the wilderness does not yield any taxes from crops, so scholars are free in this world.  And another Midrash taught that the Torah was given in the wilderness because they preserve the Torah who keep themselves separate like a wilderness.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 19:26.</ref>

The [[Gemara]] noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} happened in "the ''second'' month, in the second year," while {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} happened "in the ''first'' month of the second year," and asked why the Torah presented the chapters beginning at {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1|HE}} before {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9,|HE}} out of chronological order.  Rav Menasia bar Tahlifa said in [[Abba Arika|Rav's]] name that this proved that there is no chronological order in the Torah.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 6b.]</ref>

[[Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak]] noted that both {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} begin, "And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai," and deduced that just as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} happened (in the words of that verse) "on the first day of the second month," so too {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} happened at the beginning of the month.  And as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} addressed the [[Passover]] offering, which the Israelites were to bring on the 14th of the month, the Gemara concluded that one should expound the laws of a holiday two weeks before the holiday.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 6b.]</ref>

[[File:Esther haram.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Esther (1878 painting by [[Edwin Long]])]] 
A Midrash taught that when God is about to make Israel great, God explicitly states the place, the day, the month, the year, and the era, as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} says, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt.  The Midrash continued that God then said to the Israelites (rereading {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:2|HE}}): Raise to greatness all the congregation of the children of Israel. (Interpreting raise the head  {{Hebrew| -}}  to mean raise to greatness.)<ref>Numbers Rabbah 1:1.</ref>

A Midrash explained the specificity of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} with a parable.  A king married a wife and did not give her a legal marriage contract.  He then sent her away without giving her a bill of divorce.  He did the same to a second wife and a third, giving them neither a marriage contract nor a bill of divorce.  Then he saw a poor, well-born orphan girl whom he desired to marry.  He told his best man (''shoshbin'') not to deal with her as with the previous ones, as she was well-born, modest in her actions and worthy.  The king directed that his aide draw up a marriage contract for her, stating the period of seven years, the year, the month, the day of the month, and the region, in the same way that {{Bibleverse-lb||Esther|2:16|HE}} writes about [[Esther]], So Esther was taken to king [[Ahasuerus]] into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month [[Tevet]], in the seventh year of his reign.  So God did not state when God created the generation of the Flood and did not state when God removed them from the world, except insofar as {{Bibleverse||Genesis|7:11|HE}} reports, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up.  The same fate befell the generation of the Dispersal after the [[Tower of Babel]] and the generation of Egypt; Scripture does not indicate when God created then or when they passed away.  But when Israel appeared, God told Moses that God would not act towards them as God did towards those earlier generations, as they were descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]].  God instructed that Moses record for them the precise month, day of the month, year, region, and city in which God lifted them up.  Therefore {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} says: And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, indicating the region; in the tent of meeting, indicating the province; in the second year, indicating the precise year; in the second month, indicating the precise month; on the first day of the month, indicating the precise day of the month; and after they were come out of Egypt, indicating the era.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 1:5.</ref>

[[File:Joseph Faithful in Prison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joseph Interpreting the Chief Butlers and the Chief Bakers Dreams (illustration from a Bible card published 1907 by the Providence Lithograph Company)]]
Rabbi Phinehas the son of Idi noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:2|HE}} says, Lift up the head of all the congregation of the children of Israel, not Exalt the head or Magnify the head, but Lift up the head, like a man who says to the executioner, Take off the head of So-and-So.  Thus {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:2|HE}} conveys a hidden message with the expression Lift up the head.  If the Israelites were worthy, they would rise to greatness, with the words Lift up having the same meaning as in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|40:13|HE}} when it says (as [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] interpreted the chief butlers dream), Pharaoh shall lift up your head, and restore you to your office.  If they were not worthy, they would all die, with the words Lift up having the same meaning as in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|40:19|HE}} when it says (as Joseph interpreted the chief bakers dream), Pharaoh shall lift up your head from of you, and shall hang you on a tree.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 1:11.</ref>

A Midrash taught that the Israelites were counted on ten occasions:<ref>Midrash [[Tanhuma]], Ki Sisa 9.</ref> (1) when they went down to Egypt,<ref>{{Bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|10:22.|HE}}</ref> (2) when they went up out of Egypt,<ref>{{Bibleverse-lb||Exodus|12:37.|HE}}</ref> (3) at the first census in Numbers,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:146.|HE}}</ref> (4) at the second census in Numbers,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Numbers|26:165.|HE}}</ref> (5) once for the banners, (6) once in the time of [[Joshua]] for the division of the land of Israel, (7) once by [[Saul]],<ref>[[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|11:8.|HE}}</ref> (8) a second time by Saul,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:4.|HE}}</ref> (9) once by [[David]],<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:9.|HE}}</ref> and (10) once in the time of [[Ezra]].<ref>{{Bibleverse-lb||Ezra|2:64.|HE}}</ref>

Rav Aha bar Jacob taught that for the purposes of numbering fighting men (as in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:13|HE}}), a man over 60 years of age was excluded just as was one under 20 years of age.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_121.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 121b.]</ref>

The Rabbis taught in a [[Baraita]] that upon entering a barn to measure the new grain one should recite the blessing, "May it be Your will O Lord, our God, that You may send blessing upon the work of our hands."  Once one has begun to measure, one should say, "Blessed be the One who sends blessing into this heap."  If, however, one first measured the grain and then recited the blessing, then prayer is in vain, because blessing is not to be found in anything that has been already weighed or measured or numbered, but only in a thing hidden from sight.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Taanith.pdf Babylonian Talmud Taanit 8b.]</ref>

[[File:Philippoteaux The Numbering of the Israelites.jpg|thumb|450px|left|The Numbering of the Israelites (engraving by [[Henri Flix Emmanuel Philippoteaux]])]]

[[Rabbi Isaac the smith|Rabbi Isaac]] taught that it is forbidden to count Israel even for the purpose of fulfilling a commandment, as {{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|11:8|HE}} can be read, And he numbered them with pebbles ({{Hebrew|}}, ''be-bezek''). [[Rav Ashi]] demurred, asking how Rabbi Isaac knew that the word {{Hebrew|}}, ''bezek'', in {{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|11:8|HE}} means being broken pieces (that is, pebbles).  Rav Ashi suggested that perhaps {{Hebrew|}}, ''Bezek'', is the name of a place, as in {{Bibleverse-lb||Judges|1:5,|HE}} which says, And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek ({{Hebrew|}}, ''be-bezek''). Rav Ashi argued that the prohibition of counting comes from {{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:4,|HE}} which can be read, And Saul summoned the people and numbered them with sheep ({{Hebrew|}}, ''telaim''). [[Eleazar ben Shammua|Rabbi Eleazar]] taught that whoever counts Israel transgresses a Biblical prohibition, as {{Bibleverse-lb||Hosea|2:1|HE}} says, Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which ''cannot be measured''. [[Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak|Rav Nahman bar Isaac]] said that such a person would transgress two prohibitions, for {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} says, Which cannot be measured nor numbered. Rabbi [[Samuel ben Nahman|Samuel bar Nahmani]] reported that [[Rabbi Jonathan]] noted a potential contradiction, as {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} says, Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea (implying a finite number, but {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} also says, Which cannot be numbered (implying that they will not have a finite number).  The Gemara answered that there is no contradiction, for the latter part of {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} speaks of the time when Israel fulfils Gods will, while the earlier part of {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} speaks of the time when they do not fulfill Gods will.  [[Judah the Prince|Rabbi]] said on behalf of Abba Jose ben Dosthai that there is no contradiction, for the latter part of {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} speaks of counting done by human beings, while the earlier part of {{Bibleverse||Hosea|2:1|HE}} speaks of counting by Heaven.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Yoma.pdf Babylonian Talmud Yoma 22b.]</ref>

The Gemara taught that taking a census required atonement.  Rabbi Eleazar taught that God told David that David called God an inciter, but God would make David stumble over a thing that even school-children knew, namely, that which {{Bibleverse||Exodus|30:12|HE}} says, When you take the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul into the Lord . . . that there be no plague among them.  Forthwith, as [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|21:1|HE}} reports, [[Satan]] stood up against Israel, and as {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:1|HE}} reports, He stirred up David against them saying, Go, number Israel.  And when David did number them, he took no ransom from them, and as {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:15|HE}} reports, So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed.  The Gemara asked what {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:15|HE}} meant by the time appointed.  Samuel the elder, the son-in-law of [[Hanina bar Hama|Rabbi Hanina]], answered in the name of Rabbi Hanina:  From the time of slaughtering the continual offering (at dawn) until the time of sprinkling the blood.  [[Yochanan bar Nafcha|Rabbi Johanan]] said it meant at midday.  Reading the continuation of {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:16,|HE}} And He said to the [[Angels in Judaism|Angel]] that destroyed the people, It is enough ({{Hebrew|}}, ''rav''), Rabbi Eleazar taught that God told the Angel to take a great man ({{Hebrew|}}, ''rav'') from among them, through whose death many sins could be expiated.  So [[Abishai (biblical figure)|Abishai]] son of [[Zeruiah]] then died, and he was individually equal in worth to the greater part of the [[Sanhedrin]].  Reading {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21:15,|HE}} And as he was about to destroy, the Lord beheld, and He repented, the Gemara ask what God beheld.  Rav said God beheld Jacob, as {{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:3|HE}} reports, And Jacob said when he beheld them. [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] said that God beheld the ashes of the ram of Isaac, as {{Bibleverse||Genesis|22:8|HE}} says, God will see for Himself the lamb. Rabbi [[Rabbi Isaac the smith|Isaac Nappaha]] taught that God saw the atonement money that {{Bibleverse||Exodus|30:16|HE}} reports God required Moses to collect.  For in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|30:16,|HE}} God said, And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for your souls.' (Thus God said that at some future time, the money would provide atonement.)  Alternatively, Rabbi Johanan taught that God saw the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]].  For {{Bibleverse||Genesis|22:14|HE}} explained the meaning of the name that Abraham gave to the mountain where Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac to be, In the mount where the Lord is seen. ([[Solomon]] later built the Temple on that mountain, and God saw the merit of the sacrifices there.)  Rabbi [[Jacob b. Idi|Jacob bar Iddi]] and Rabbi [[Samuel ben Nahman|Samuel bar Nahmani]] differed on the matter.  One said that God saw the atonement money that {{Bibleverse||Exodus|30:16|HE}} reports God required Moses to collect from the Israelites, while the other said that God saw the Temple.  The Gemara concluded that the more likely view was that God saw the Temple, as {{Bibleverse||Genesis|22:14|HE}} can be read to say, As it will be said on that day, in the mount where the Lord is seen.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_62.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 62b.] Reprinted in, e.g., ''Talmud Bavli''.

The Gemara deduced from the words "by their families, by their fathers houses" in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:2|HE}} that the Torah identifies families by the father's line.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/nazir/nazir_49.html Babylonian Talmud Nazir 49a,] [http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_109.html#PARTb Bava Batra 109b,] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Bechoroth.pdf Bekhorot 47a.]</ref>

The [[Mekhilta]] found support in the words "they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers' houses" in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:18|HE}} for Rabbi Eliezer ha-Kappar's proposition that the Israelites displayed virtue by not changing their names.<ref>Mekhilta Pisha 5.</ref>

Rabbi Judah ben Shalom taught that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:49|HE}} excluded the Levites from being numbered with the rest of the Israelites for their own benefit, for as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|14:29|HE}} reports, "all that were numbered" died in the wilderness, but because the Levites were numbered separately, they entered the land of Israel.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 3:7; see also Numbers Rabbah 1:1112.</ref> A Midrash offered another explanation for why the Levites were not numbered with the Israelites:  The Levites were the palace-guard and it would not have been consonant with the dignity of a king that his own legion should be numbered with the other legions.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 1:12.</ref>

The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that when the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, the Levitical camp established in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:50|HE}} served as the place of refuge to which manslayers could flee.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Makkoth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Makkot 12b.]</ref>

[[File:Knesset Menorah P5200009 Hilel.JPG|140px|thumb|right|Hillel (sculpture at the [[Knesset]] Menorah, Jerusalem)]]
Building upon the prohibition of approaching the holy place in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:51,|HE}} the Gemara taught that a person who unwittingly entered the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] court without atonement was liable to bring a sin-offering, but a person who entered deliberately incurred the penalty of being cut off from the Jewish people, or ''karet''.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Menachoth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Menachot 28b.]</ref>

A non-Jew asked [[Shammai]] to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] him to Judaism on condition that Shammai appoint him [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]].  Shammai pushed him away with a builder's ruler.  The non-Jew then went to [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], who converted him.  The convert then read Torah, and when he came to the injunction of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:51,|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0403.htm#10 3:10], and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0418.htm#7 18:7] that "the common man who draws near shall be put to death," he asked Hillel to whom the injunction applied.  Hillel answered that it applied even to David, King of Israel, who had not been a priest.  Thereupon the convert reasoned [[Talmudical_Hermeneutics#Kal_va-Chomer_.28.D7.A7.D7.9C_.D7.95.D7.97.D7.95.D7.9E.D7.A8.29|''a fortiori'']] that if the injunction applied to all (non-priestly) Israelites, whom in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:22|HE}} God had called "my firstborn," how much more so would the injunction apply to a mere convert, who came among the Israelites with just his staff and bag.  Then the convert returned to Shammai, quoted the injunction, and remarked on how absurd it had been for him to ask Shammai to appoint him High Priest.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_31.html Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 31a.]</ref>

The Gemara relates that once Rabban [[Gamaliel]], Rabbi [[Eleazar ben Azariah]], Rabbi [[Joshua ben Hananiah|Joshua]], and Rabbi [[Akiba ben Joseph|Akiba]] went to [[Jerusalem]] after the destruction of the Temple, and just as they came to [[Mount Scopus]], they saw a fox emerging from the [[Holy of Holies]].  The first three Rabbis began to cry, but Akiba smiled.  The three asked him why he smiled, but Akiba asked them why they wept.  Quoting {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:51,|HE}} they told him that they wept because a place of which it was once said, "And the common man that draws near shall be put to death," had become the haunt of foxes.  Akiba replied that he smiled because this fulfilled the prophecy of Uriah the priest, who prophesied (along with Micah, as reported in {{Bibleverse-lb||Jeremiah|26:1820|HE}}) that "Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the House as the high places of a forest."  And {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|8:2|HE}} linked Uriah's prophecy with [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah's]].  And {{Bibleverse-lb||Zechariah|8:4|HE}} prophesied that "[t]here shall yet old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem."  So the fulfillment of Uriah's prophecy gave Akiba certainty that Zechariah's hopeful prophecy would also find fulfillment.  The others then told Akiba that he had comforted them.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Makkoth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Makkot 24b.]</ref>

===Numbers chapter 2===
Rabbi Eliezer in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Zimra taught that whenever the Israelites were numbered for a proper purpose, they lost no numbers; but whenever they were numbered without a proper purpose, they suffered a diminution.  Rabbi Eliezer taught that they were numbered for a proper purpose in connection with the standards (as reported in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:2|HE}}) and the division of the land, but were numbered without a proper purpose (as reported in {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24|HE}}) in the days of David.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 2:17.</ref>

Of the banners ({{Hebrew|}}, ''degel'') in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:2|HE}}, a Midrash taught that each tribe had a distinctive flag and a different color corresponding to the precious stones on Aaron's breastplate, and that it was from these banners that governments learned to provide themselves with flags of various colors.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 2:7.</ref> And another Midrash cited the words "his standard over me is love" in [[Song of Songs]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Song|2:4|HE}} to teach that it was with a sign of great love that God organized the Israelites under standards like the ministering angels.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 2:3.</ref>

A Midrash used the words "at a distance" in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:2|HE}} to help define the distance that one may travel on the Sabbath, for the Israelites would need to be close enough to approach the ark on the Sabbath.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 2:9.</ref>

A Midrash taught that [[Korah]], [[Dathan]], [[Abiram]], and On all fell in together in their conspiracy, as described in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|16:1,|HE}} because they lived near each other on the same side of the camp.  The Midrash thus taught that the saying, Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbor! applies to Dathan and Abiram.  {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:29|HE}} reports that the descendants of Kohath, among whom Korah was numbered, lived on the south side of the Tabernacle.  And {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:10|HE}} reports that the descendants of Reuben, among whom Dathan and Abiram were numbered, lived close by, as they also lived on the south side of the Tabernacle.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 18:5.</ref>

[[File:Guercino Jacob Ephraim and Manasseh.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Yakub, Efraim, dan Manasye (lukisan dari abad ke-17 oleh [[Guercino]])]]
The Gemara cited {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:1821|HE}} to help examine the consequences of Jacob's blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|48:56.|HE}}  Rav Aha bar Jacob taught that a tribe that had an inheritance of land was called a "congregation," but a tribe that had no possession was not a "congregation."  Thus Rav Aha bar Jacob taught that the tribe of Levi was not called a "congregation."  The Gemara questioned Rav Aha's teaching, asking whether there would then be fewer than 12 tribes.  [[Abaye]] replied quoting Jacob's words in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|48:5:|HE}} "Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine."  But [[Abba ben Joseph bar ama|Rava]] interpreted the words "They shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance" in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|48:6|HE}} to show that Ephraim and Manasseh were thereafter regarded as comparable to other tribes only in regard to their inheritance of the land, not in any other respect.  The Gemara challenged Rava's interpretation, noting that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|2:1821|HE}} mentions Ephraim and Manasseh separately as tribes in connection with their assembling around the camp by their banners.  The Gemara replied to its own challenge by positing that their campings were like their possessions, in order to show respect to their banners.  The Gemara persisted in arguing that Ephraim and Manasseh were treated separately by noting that they were also separated with regard to their princes.  The Gemara responded that this was done in order to show honor to the princes and to avoid having to choose the prince of one tribe to rule over the other.  [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|8:65|HE}} indicates that Solomon celebrated seven days of dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and Moses celebrated twelve days of dedication of the [[Tabernacle]] instead of seven in order to show honor to the princes and to avoid having to choose the prince of one tribe over the other.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/horayoth/horayoth_6.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Horayot 6b.]</ref>

===Numbers chapter 3===
Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught in [[Rabbi Jonathan]]'s name that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:12|HE}} referred to Aaron's sons as descendants of Aaron and Moses because Moses taught them, showing that Scripture ascribes merit to one who teaches Torah to a neighbor's child as if the teacher had begotten the child.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_19.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 19b.]</ref>

A Midrash noted that Scripture records the death of Nadab and Abihu in numerous places, including {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:4.|HE}}<ref>See {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|10:2|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:1;|HE}} {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Numbers|26:61;|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|24:2.|HE}}</ref> This teaches that God grieved for Nadab and Abihu, for they were dear to God.  And thus {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|10:3|HE}} quotes God to say: Through them who are near to Me I will be sanctified.<ref>Rabbah Bamidbar 2:23.</ref>

[[File:Holman Priest High Priest Levite.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Priest, High Priest, and Levite (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible)]]
The Mishnah taught that as the Levites exempted the Israelites firstborn in the wilderness, it followed ''a fortiori'' that they should exempt their own animals from the requirement to offer the firstborn.<ref>Mishnah Bekhorot 1:1; [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Bechoroth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Bekhorot 3b.]</ref> The Gemara questioned whether {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:45|HE}} taught that the Levites animals exempted the Israelites animals.  Abaye read the Mishnah to mean that if the Levites animals released the Israelites animals, it followed ''a fortiori'' that the Levites animals should release their own firstborn.  But Raba countered that the Mishnah meant that the Levites themselves exempted the Israelites firstborn.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Bechoroth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Bekhorot 4a.]</ref>

Tractate [[Bekhorot]] in the Mishnah, [[Tosefta]], and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of the firstborn in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:1113.|HE}}<ref>Mishnah Bekhorot 1:19:8; Tosefta Bekhorot 1:17:15; [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Bechoroth.pdf Babylonian Talmud Bekhorot 2a61a.]</ref>

[[File:Menorah7a.png|thumb|right|250px|the lampstand, the responsibility of the Kohathites]]
A Midrash taught that the Levites camped on the four sides of the Tabernacle in accordance with their duties.  The Midrash explained that from the west came snow, hail, cold, and heat, and thus God placed the Gershonites on the west, as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:25|HE}} indicates that their service was "the tent, the covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting," which could shield against snow, hail, cold, and heat.  The Midrash explained that from the south came the dew and rain that bring blessing to the world, and there God placed the Kohathites, who bore the ark that carried the Torah, for as {{Bibleverse-lb||Leviticus|26:34|HE}} and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0326.htm#15 1519] teach, the rains depend on the observance of the Torah.  The Midrash explained that from the north came darkness, and thus the Merarites camped there, as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:31|HE}} indicates that their service was the carrying of wood ("the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof") which {{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|10:8|HE}} teaches counteract idolatrous influences when it says, "The chastisement of vanities is wood."  And the Midrash explained that from the east comes light, and thus Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped there, because they were scholars and men of pious deeds, bringing atonement by their prayer and sacrifices.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 3:12.</ref>

A Midrash taught that Korah took issue with Moses in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|16:1|HE}} because Moses had (as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:30|HE}} reports) appointed [[Elizaphan]] the son of [[Uzziel]] as prince of the [[Kohathites]], and Korah was (as {{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:21|HE}} reports) son of Uzziel's older brother [[Izhar]], and thus had a claim to leadership prior to Elizaphan.<ref>Midrash [[Tanhuma]] Korah 1.</ref>

[[File:Temple showbread.JPG|thumb|left|350px|Priests replacing the showbread, the table for which was the responsibility of the Kohathites (19th century illustration)]]
===Numbers chapter 4===
A Midrash noted that God ordered the Kohathites counted first in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1|HE}} and only thereafter ordered the Gershonites counted in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:21,|HE}} even though Gershon was the firstborn and Scripture generally honors the firstborn.  The Midrash taught that Scripture gives Kohath precedence over Gershon because the Kohathites bore the ark that carried the Torah.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 6:1.</ref> Similarly, another Midrash taught that God ordered the Kohathites counted first because Kohath was most holy, for Aaron the priest  who was most holy  descended from Kohath, while Gershon was only holy.  But the Midrash taught that Gershon did not forfeit his status as firstborn, because Scripture uses the same language, "Lift up the head of the sons of," with regard to Kohath in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:2|HE}} and with regard to Gershon in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:22.|HE}}  And {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:22|HE}} says "they also" with regard to the Gershonites so that one should not suppose that the Gershonites were numbered second because they were inferior to the Kohathites; rather {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:22|HE}} says "they also" to indicate that the Gershonites were also like the Kohathites in every respect, and the Kohathites were placed first in this connection as a mark of respect to the Torah.  In other places (for example, {{Bibleverse||Genesis|46:11,|HE}}  {{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:16,|HE}}  {{Bibleverse||Numbers|3:17|HE}}  and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0426.htm#57 26:57], and {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|23:6|HE}}), however, Scripture places Gershon before Kohath.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 6:2.</ref>

A Midrash noted that in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1|HE}} "the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron" to direct them to count the Kohathites and in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:21|HE}} "the Lord spoke to Moses" to direct him to count the Gershonites, but {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:29|HE}} does not report that "the Lord spoke" to direct them to count the Merarites.  The Midrash deduced that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:29|HE}} employed the words "the Lord spoke" so as to give honor to Gershon as the firstborn, and to give him the same status as Kohath.  The Midrash then noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1|HE}} reported that God spoke "to Aaron" with regard to the Kohathites but {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:21|HE}} did not report communication to Aaron with regard to the Gershonites.  The Midrash taught that God excluded Aaron from all Divine communications to Moses and that passages that mention Aaron do not report that God spoke to Aaron, but include Aaron's name in sections that concern Aaron to indicate that God spoke to Moses so that he might repeat what he heard to Aaron.  Thus {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1|HE}} mentions Aaron regarding the Kohathites because Aaron and his sons assigned the Kohathites their duties, since (as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:15|HE}} relates) the Kohathites were not permitted to touch the ark or any of the vessels until Aaron and his sons had covered them.  In the case of the Gershonites, however, the Midrash finds no evidence that Aaron personally interfered with them, as Ithamar supervised their tasks, and thus {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:21|HE}} does not mention Aaron in connection with the Gershonites.<ref>Numbers Rabbah 6:5.</ref>

A Midrash noted that in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:2|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:22,|HE}} God used the expression "lift up the head" to direct counting the Kohathites and Gershonites, but in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:29,|HE}} God does not use that expression to direct counting the Merarites.  The Midrash deduced that God honored the Kohathites on account of the honor of the ark and the Gershonites because Gershon was a firstborn.  But since the Merarites neither cared for the ark nor descended from a firstborn, God did not use the expression "lift up the head."<ref>Numbers Rabbah 6:4.</ref>

A Midrash noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:3,|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#23 23,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#30 30,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#35 35,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#39 39,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#43 43], and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#47 47] say that Levites "30 years old and upward" did service in the tent of meeting, while {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:24|HE}} says, "from 25 years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the tent of meeting."  The Midrash deduced that the difference teaches that all those five years, from the age of 25 to the age of 30, Levites served apprenticeships, and from that time onward they were allowed to draw near to do service.  The Midrash concluded that a Levite could not enter the Temple courtyard to do service unless he had served an apprenticeship of five years.  And the Midrash inferred from this that students who see no sign of success in their studies within a period of five years will never see any.  Rabbi Jose said that students had to see success within three years, basing his position on the words "that they should be nourished three years" in {{Bibleverse-lb||Daniel|1:5.|HE}}<ref>Numbers Rabbah 6:3.</ref>

Rav [[Hamnuna]] taught that God's decree that the generation of the spies would die in the wilderness did not apply to the Levites, for {{Bibleverse||Numbers|14:29|HE}} says, "your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from 20 years old and upward," and this implies that those who were numbered from 20 years old and upward came under the decree, while the tribe of Levi  which {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:3,|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#23 23,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#30 30,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#35 35,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#39 39,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#43 43], and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#47 47] say was numbered from 30 years old and upward  was excluded from the decree.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_121.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 121b.]</ref>

The Mishnah taught that one who stole one of the sacred vessels (''kisvot'') described in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|25:29|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:7|HE}} was struck down by zealots on the spot.<ref>Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:6; [http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_81.html#PARTb Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 81b.]</ref>

The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] found support in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1820|HE}} for the proposition in a Baraita that one who dies before age 50 has died a death of ''karet'', of being cut off from the Jewish people.  The Gemara there noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:1819|HE}} spoke of what the Kohathites should avoid doing so "that they may live, and not die."  And {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:20|HE}} enjoined that "they shall not go in to see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die."  And since {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:25|HE}} indicates that the Kohathites ceased working near the holy things at age 50, these deaths of ''karet'' would have to have occurred before the age of 50.<ref>Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 11b.</ref> The Babylonian Talmud reports that [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Rabbah]] said that deaths between the ages of 50 and 60 are also deaths by ''karet''.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Moed_Katan.pdf Babylonian Talmud Moed Katan 28a.]</ref>

==The Weekly Maqam==
[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 063.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Hosea]] (painting from [[Siena]]'s Duomo)]]
In [[the Weekly Maqam]], [[Sephardi Jews]] each week base the songs of the services on the content of that week's parashah.  For parashah Bamidbar, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Rast, the maqam that shows a beginning or an initiation of something.  This is appropriate because the parashah initiates the Book of Numbers.  In the very common case where this parashah precedes the holiday of [[Shavuot]], then the maqam that is applied is Hoseni, the maqam that symbolizes the beauty of receiving the Torah.
