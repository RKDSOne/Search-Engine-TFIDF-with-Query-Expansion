'''Paper lanterns''' come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a [[paper bag]] with a [[candle]] placed inside, although more complicated [[lantern]]s consist of a collapsible [[bamboo]] or metal frame of hoops covered with tough [[paper]]. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red.

Often associated with [[festival]]s, paper lanterns are common in [[China]] and [[Japan]] and, similarly, in [[Chinatown]]s, where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|the traditional styles]] include ''[[bonbori]]'' and ''chchin'' and there is a special style of lettering called ''[[edomoji|chchin moji]]'' used to write on them.

In China, paper lanterns can be classified into 5 distinct classes; the Baby's Bottom is the miniature class, often used in modern times with Christmas lights. The second class is the Rolling Paper, the tall, cylindrical lanterns often associated with restaurants and bars. The third class is the Tomato Light also known as Big Red; the classic round mid-size lantern. The fourth class is the Crystal Magic; the variously-shaped geometric lamps constructed of many square and triangular panes. The last is known as Buddha's Gastronomy; the large and extra large lanterns used to decorate temples and for show at festivals. Also, there are the traditional Chinese red lanterns, that can be round or capsule-shaped, usually seen in stores, at temples, or during festivals. The color red (fire) traditionally symbolizes good fortune and joy.
