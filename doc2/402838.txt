The church's mission is incomplete without ADRA's distinctive ministry."<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/14/news/mn-13136 A History of Complaints Dogs Adventist Aid Agency], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 14, 1998</ref>Much has been said about faith-based agencies taking US government funding and using those funds to further religious doctrinal missions, however ADRA does not proselytise.

=== Hubungan dengan Gereja Masehi Advent Hari Ketujuh ===
ADRA Indonesias relationship with the Church is central to the mission of both.  In common with all relationships, it undergoes change and transition through dialogue.

    To strengthen the relationship between ADRA Indonesia and the church, thereby providing for even more effective future co-operation.
    ADRA Indonesia works with those in need, regardless of their relationship to the church.
    ADRA Indonesias first focus is on meeting individuals immediate needs.
    ADRA Indonesias work is integral to the church in that it provides a social ministry - caring for needs and individuals not specifically the focus of other church institutions. Consequently, the churchs mission is incomplete without ADRA Indonesias distinctive ministry.

In fulfilling its mission, ADRA Indonesia becomes a key partner in community development.  In order to do this successfully, ADRA Indonesia must carry out the following tasks, among others:

    Successful design and implementation of all projects.
    Successful sharing of financial responsibility between ADRA Indonesia and the Church.

ADRA Indonesia representatives and community leadership work together in planning these development activities, which are then managed by the Project coordinator, under the supervision of the Programs Director/ Country Director.
