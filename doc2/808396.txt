<!--
As a highly-specialised and adaptable light infantry force, the Royal Marines are trained for rapid deployment worldwide and capable of dealing with a wide range of threats. The Royal Marines are organised into a light infantry brigade ([[3 Commando Brigade]]) and a number of separate units [[1 Assault Group Royal Marines]], 43 Commando Royal Marines formerly [[Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines]] (previously the Comacchio Group), and a company strength commitment to the [[Special Forces Support Group]]. The Corps operates in all environments and climates, though particular expertise and training is spent on [[amphibious warfare]], [[arctic warfare]], [[mountain warfare]], [[expeditionary warfare]], and its commitment to the UK's [[Rapid Reaction Force|Rapid Reaction]] Force.

Throughout its history, the Royal Marines have seen action in a number of major wars often fighting beside the [[British Army]]&nbsp; including the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Crimean War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In recent times the Corps has been largely deployed in expeditionary warfare roles such as the [[Falklands War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Bosnian War]], the [[Kosovo War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001present)|War in Afghanistan]]. The Royal Marines have close international ties with allied marine forces, particularly the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] ({{lang-nl|Korps Mariniers|links=no}}).<ref name="mod.uk">[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/TrainingAndAdventure/RoyalMarinesTrainInCalifornianDesert.htm Royal Marines Train In Californian Desert], mod.uk</ref><ref name="royalnavy.mod.uk">[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/The-Royal-Marines/About-the-Royal-Marines/Royal-Netherlands-Marine-Corps Royal Netherlands Marine Corps], royalnavy.mod.uk</ref>

===Early British Empire===
[[File:Major General John Tupper.JPG|thumb|Major General John Tupper His Majesty's Marine Forces.]]
On 5 April 1755, ''His Majesty's Marine Forces'', fifty Companies in three Divisions, headquartered at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Portsmouth]], and [[Plymouth]], were formed by Order of Council under [[Admiralty]] control. Initially all [[field officers]] were Royal Navy officers as the Royal Navy felt that the ranks of Marine field officers were largely honorary.  This meant that the farthest a Marine officer could advance was to Lieutenant Colonel. It was not until 1771 that the first Marine was promoted to Colonel. This attitude persisted well into the 1800s. During the rest of the 18th century, they served in numerous landings all over the world, the most famous being the landing at [[Belle le|Bellisle]] on the [[Brittany]] coast in 1761. They also served in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], being particularly courageous in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] led by Major [[John Pitcairn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverwhistle.co.uk/lobsters/pitcairn.html|title=Major John Pitcairn|publisher=Silverwhistle|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1788 a detachment of four companies of marines, under Major [[Robert Ross (Royal Marines officer)|Robert Ross]], accompanied the [[First Fleet]] to protect a new colony at [[Botany Bay]] ([[New South Wales]]). Due to an error the Fleet left Portsmouth without its main supply of ammunition, and were not resupplied until the Fleet docked in Rio de Janeiro midway through the voyage.<ref>Moore 1987, p.41</ref> One author has claimed that the Marines deliberately spread smallpox among Australia's indigenous population in order to reduce its military effectiveness,<ref name="whowhenwhy">{{cite journal | author = Warren Christopher |title = Smallpox at Sydney Cove  Who, When, Why | url =http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview | journal = Journal of Australian Studies | year = 2013 | doi=10.1080/14443058.2013.849750}}</ref> but this is not corroborated by contemporaneous records of the settlement and most researchers attribute the indigenous smallpox outbreak to other causes.<ref name="whowhenwhy"/><ref>{{citation |last=Warren |first=Christopher| title=Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines?  a note |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Notes_documents4.pdf |quote=several authors  including Josephine Flood, [[Alan Frost]], Charles Wilson and Judy Campbell  maintain that First Fleet smallpox did not cause the outbreak}}</ref>

In 1802, largely at the instigation of Admiral the Earl St. Vincent, they were titled the ''Royal Marines'' by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The ''Royal Marines Artillery'' (RMA) was formed as a separate unit in 1804 to man the artillery in [[bomb ketch]]es. These had been manned by the Army's [[Royal Artillery|Royal Regiment of Artillery]], but a lawsuit by a Royal Artillery officer resulted in a court decision that Army officers were not subject to Naval orders. As RMA uniforms were the blue of the Royal Regiment of Artillery they were nicknamed the "Blue Marines" and the Infantry element, who wore the scarlet uniforms of the British infantry, became known as the "Red Marines", often given the semi-derogatory nickname "Lobsters" by sailors.<ref name=crest>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/item/researching-family-and-royal-marine-history/the-crest-colours-beret-nicknames-and-prayers-of-the-royal-marines|title=The crest, colours, beret, nicknames and prayers of the Royal Marines|publisher=Royal Marines Museum|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the Royal Marines participated in every [[:Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom|notable naval battle]] on board the Royal Navy's ships and also took part in multiple amphibious actions. Marines had a dual function aboard ships of the Royal Navy in this period; routinely, they ensured the security of the ship's officers and supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship's crew, and in battle, they engaged the enemy's crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/Britain/Marines/c_marines.html|title=Per Mare Per Terram  the Royal Marines 17931815|publisher=Napoleon Series|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

In the Caribbean theatre volunteers from freed French slaves on [[Marie Galante]] were used to form the [[Corps of Colonial Marines|1st Corps of Colonial Marines]]. These men bolstered the ranks, helping the British to hold the island until reinforcements arrived. This practice was repeated during the [[War of 1812]], where escaped American slaves were formed into the [[Corps of Colonial Marines|2nd Corps of Colonial Marines]]. These men were commanded by Royal Marines officers and fought alongside their regular Royal Marines counterparts at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~1812RoyalMarines/history.htm|title=The Royal Marines in the War of 1812|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

Throughout the war Royal Marines units raided up and down the east coast of America including up the [[Battle of Hampden|Penobscot River]] and in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. They fought in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and later helped capture [[Battle of Fort Bowyer|Fort Bowyer]] in Mobile Bay in what was the last action of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/fortbowyer.html|title=The Battle of Fort Bowyer, Alabama|publisher=Explore Southern History|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1855 the Infantry forces were renamed the ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'' (RMLI). During the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and 1855, three Royal Marines earned the [[Victoria Cross]], two in the Crimea and one in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].<ref name=cross>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/item/researching-family-and-royal-marine-history/the-victoria-cross-the-royal-marin|title=The Victoria Cross and the Royal Marines|publisher=Royal Marines Museum|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1862 the name was slightly altered to ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. The [[Royal Navy]] did not fight any other ships after 1850 and became interested in landings by Naval Brigades. In these Naval Brigades, the function of the Royal Marines was to land first and act as skimishers ahead of the sailor Infantry and Artillery. This skirmishing was the traditional function of Light Infantry. For most of their history, British Marines had been organised as [[fusilier]]s. In the rest of the 19th Century the Royal Marines served in many landings especially in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s (18391842 and 18561860) against the Chinese. These were all successful except for the landing at the Mouth of the [[Hai He|Peiho]] in 1859, where [[James Hope (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Sir James Hope]] ordered a landing across extensive mud flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/China2.htm|title=Second Anglo-Chinese War ("Opium war") of 1856  1860 (part 2)|publisher=William Loney|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>{{dl|date=November 2015}}

The Royal Marines also played a prominent role in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China (1900), where a Royal Marine earned a [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=cross/>

Pursuing a career in the Marines had been considered social suicide through much of the 18th and 19th centuries since Marine officers had a lower standing than their counterparts in the Royal Navy. An effort was made in 1907 through the common entry or "Selborne Scheme" to reduce the professional differences between RN and RM officers through a system of common entry that provided for an initial period of service where both groups performed the same roles and underwent the same training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snr.org.uk/class-warfare-selborne-scheme-royal-navys-battle-technology-social-hierarchy/|title=Class Warfare and the Selborne Scheme: The Royal Navys battle over technology and social hierarchy|publisher=The Mariner's Mirror|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

===Perang Dunia===

====Perang Dunia I====
During the [[World War I|First World War]], in addition to their usual stations aboard ship, Royal Marines were part of the [[Royal Naval Division]] which landed in [[Belgium]] in 1914 to help defend [[Antwerp]] and later took part in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|amphibious landing at Gallipoli]] in 1915. It also served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The Division's first two commanders were Royal Marine Artillery Generals. Other Royal Marines acted as landing parties in the Naval campaign against the Turkish fortifications in the Dardanelles before the Gallipoli landing. They were sent ashore to assess damage to Turkish fortifications after bombardment by British and French ships and, if necessary, to complete their destruction. The Royal Marines were the last to leave Gallipoli, replacing both British and [[French Army|French troops]] in a neatly planned and executed withdrawal from the beaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/rmli_gallipoli.html|title=The RMLI move to, and deployment at, Gallipoli|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

The Royal Marines also took part in the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] in 1918. Five Royal Marines earned the Victoria Cross in the First World War, two at Zeebrugge, one at Gallipoli, one at Jutland and one on the Western Front.<ref name=cross/>

After the war Royal Marines took part in the [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied intervention in Russia]]. In 1919, the 6th Battalion RMLI mutinied and was disbanded at Murmansk. The Royal Marine Artillery (RMA) and Royal Marine Light Infantry (RMLI) were amalgamated on 22 June 1923.<ref>[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webtype=0&IssueNumber=32846&PageDuplicate=x0&pageNumber=4&SearchFor=graciously%20pleased&selMedalType=&selHonourType= London Gazette], 20 July 1923</ref> Post-war demobilisation had seen the Royal Marines reduced from 55,000 (1918) to 15,000 in 1922 and there was [[Treasury]] pressure for a further reduction to 6,000 or even the entire disbandment of the Corps. As a compromise an establishment of 9,500 was settled upon but this meant that two separate branches could no longer be maintained. The abandonment of the Marine's artillery role meant that the Corps would subsequently have to rely on Royal Artillery support when ashore, that the title of Royal Marines would apply to the entire Corps and that only a few specialists would now receive gunnery training. As a form of consolation the dark blue and red uniform of the Royal Marine Artillery now became the full dress of the entire Corps. Royal Marine officers and SNCO's however continue to wear the historic scarlet in [[mess dress]] to the present day. The ranks of [[Private (rank)|Private]], used by the RMLI, and [[Gunner (rank)|Gunner]], used by the RMA, were abolished and replaced by the rank of Marine.<ref>[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webType=0&PageDuplicate=x0%20%20%20%20%20%20&issueNumber=32871&pageNumber=0&SearchFor=graciously%20pleased&selMedalType=&selHonourType= London Gazette], 16 October 1923</ref>

[[Image:Commandos archery.jpg|thumb|left|[[British Commandos]] in action during [[Operation Archery]], Norway.]]

====Perang Dunia II====
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], a small party of Royal Marines were first ashore at [[Namsos in April 1940]], seizing the approaches to the Norwegian town preparatory to a landing by the [[British Army]] two days later. The Royal Marines formed the [[Royal Marine Division]] as an amphibiously trained division, parts of which served at Dakar and in the capture of [[Madagascar]]. In addition the Royal Marines formed Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisations (MNBDOs) similar to the [[United States Marine Corps]] Defense Battalions. One of these took part in the defence of [[Battle of Crete|Crete]]. Royal Marines also served in [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] and in [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], where due to losses they were joined with remnants of the 2nd Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] to form the "Plymouth Argylls". The Royal Marines formed one Commando (A Commando) which served at [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]]. One month after [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]], most of the 11th Royal Marine Battalion was killed or captured in an ill staged amphibious landing at Tobruk in [[Operation Agreement]], again the Marines were involved with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, this time the 1st Battalion. In 1942 the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as [[Commando]]s, joining the [[British Commandos|Army Commandos]]. The Division command structure became a Special Service Brigade command. The support troops became landing craft crew and saw extensive action on D-Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/5354580/D-Day-Heroic-battle-in-Port-en-Bessin.html|title=D-Day: Heroic battle in Port-en-Bessin|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 May 2009|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

[[Image:House to house fighting at Riva Bella near Ouistreham.jpg|right|thumb|Men of No 4 Commando engaged in house to house fighting with the Germans at Riva Bella, near [[Ouistreham]].]]

A total of four [[Special Service Brigade]]s (later Commando brigade) were raised during the war, and Royal Marines were represented in all of them. A total of nine RM Commandos ([[Battalion]]s) were raised during the war, numbered from 40 to 48. [[1st Special Service Brigade|1 Commando Brigade]] had just one RM Battalion, [[45 Commando|No 45 Commando]]. [[2nd Special Service Brigade|2 Commando Brigade]] had two RM battalions, Nos [[40 Commando|40]] and [[43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines|43]] Commandos. [[3 Commando Brigade]] also had two, Nos [[42 Commando|42]] and [[No. 44 (Royal Marine) Commando|44]] Commandos. [[4th Special Service Brigade|4 Commando Brigade]] was entirely Royal Marine after March 1944, comprising Nos [[41 Commando|41]], [[No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando|46]], [[No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando|47]] and [[No. 48 (Royal Marine) Commando|48]] Commandos. 1 Commando Brigade took part in first in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and then assaults on [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Normandy landings|Normandy]], campaigns in the [[Rhineland]] and [[Operation Plunder|crossing the Rhine]]. 2 Commando Brigade was involved in the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno landings]], [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]], [[Operation Roast|Comacchio]], and operations in the [[Gothic Line#The Allied attack|Argenta Gap]]. 3 Commando Brigade served in Sicily and [[Burma Campaign 1944|Burma]]. 4 Commando Brigade served in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] and in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] on the island of [[Walcheren]] during the clearing of [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedops.com/Walcheren.htm|title=Operation Infatuate|publisher=Combined Operations|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

In January 1945, two further RM Brigades were formed, 116th Brigade and 117th Brigade. Both were conventional Infantry, rather than in the Commando role. 116th Brigade saw some action in the [[Netherlands]], but 117th Brigade was hardly used operationally. In addition one Landing Craft Assault (LCA) unit was stationed in Australia late in the war as a training unit. In 1946 the Army Commandos were disbanded, leaving the Royal Marines to continue the Commando role (with supporting Army elements). A number of Royal Marines served as pilots during the Second World War. It was a Royal Marines officer who led the attack by a formation of [[Blackburn Skua]]s that sank the German cruiser [[SMS Knigsberg|Knigsberg]].  Eighteen Royal Marines commanded [[Fleet Air Arm]] squadrons during the course of the war, and with the formation of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] were well-represented in the final drive on Japan. Captains and Majors generally commanded squadrons, whilst in one case Lt. Colonel R.C.Hay on [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']] was Air Group Co-ordinator from [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] of the entire [[British Pacific Fleet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366169/Cdr-Ronnie-Hay.html|title=Obituary:Colonel Ronnie Hay|publisher=The Telegraph|date=24 December 2001|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

Throughout the war Royal Marines continued in their traditional role of providing ships detachments and manning a proportion of the guns on [[Cruiser]]s and Capital Ships.  They also provided the crew for the UK's Minor [[Landing Craft]] and the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group manned [[Cromwell tank|Centaur IV]] tanks on [[D Day]] one of these is still on display at [[Pegasus Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2504563/D-Day-tanks-found-on-seabed.html|title=D-Day tanks found on seabed|date=5 August 2008|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

===Post-colonial era===
The Corps underwent a notable change after 1945 however, when the Royal Marines took on the main responsibility for the role and training of the [[British Commandos]]. The Royal Marines have an illustrious history, and since their creation in 1942 Royal Marines Commandos have engaged on active operations across the globe, every year, except 1968.<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/royalmarines/units-and-deployments/3-commando-brigade/brigade-information/history History of RM deployments]</ref>

===Personnel===
[[File:Operation Sond Chara 02.jpg|thumb|Royal Marines in [[Afghanistan]]]]
The Royal Marines are part of the Naval Service and under the full command of [[Fleet Commander]]. The rank structure of the corps is similar to that of the [[British Army]] with officers and other ranks recruited and initially trained separately from other naval personnel, Women are only permitted to serve in the [[Royal Marines Band Service]]. On average, 1,200 recruits and 2,000 potential recruits, and 400 potential officers attend training courses and acquaint courses at CTCRM every year.

At its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 70,000 people served in the Royal Marines. Following the Allied victory the Royal Marines were quickly reduced to a post-war strength of 13,000. When [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] finally came to an end in 1960, the Marines were again reduced, but this time to an all [[British Commandos|Commando-trained]] force of 9,000 personnel.<ref>Nicholas van der Bijl and Nick Bijl, ''The Royal Marines 193993'', Osprey Publishing, 1995</ref>

As of October 2014 the Royal Marines had a strength of 7,760 Regular<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/373597/20141029_RN_RM__Service_Quarterly_Pocket_Brief_Oct14.pdf gov.uk MoD  Royal Navy & Royal Marines quarterly pocket brief], October 2014.

'''Lapis baja''' The Royal Marines maintain no heavy armoured units, instead, they operate a fleet of lightly armoured and highly mobile vehicles intended for amphibious landings or rapid deployment. The primary [[Armoured fighting vehicle]] operated by the Armoured Support Group is the [[BvS 10|BvS 10 Viking]] All Terrain Armoured Vehicle.<ref>[[#IISS2010|IISS 2010]], pp. 168</ref> Other lighter vehicles include the [[Land Rover Wolf]] Armoured Patrol Vehicle, the [[Jackal (MWMIK)]] Armoured Vehicle and the [[Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]] High Mobility All Terrain Vehicle.<ref>[http://www.wisconsin-pinzgauers.org/ Joint Committees On Transportation Holds Public Hearing Re: Trans 123] www.wisconsin-pinzgauers.org</ref>

'''Artileri''' Artillery support is provided by the [[29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery]] of the British Army using the [[L118 Light Gun]], a 105&nbsp;mm towed [[howitzer]]. The regiment is [[British Commandos|Commando-trained]].

'''Penerbangan''' The [[Commando Helicopter Force]] of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] provides transport helicopters in support of the Royal Marines. It currently uses both [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] transport and [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] transport/reconnaissance [[helicopter]]s to provide direct aviation support for the Corps. The Sea Kings will be replaced by 25 Merlins transferred from the [[Royal Air Force]] and upgraded during 20172020. In addition the [[Royal Air Force]] additionally provides [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook]] heavy-lift, [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin HC3]] and [[Arospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma HC2]] medium-lift, transport helicopters.

'''Kapal''' The Royal Marines operate a varied fleet of [[List of active Royal Marines military watercraft|military watercraft]] designed to transport troops from ship to shore or conduct river or estuary patrols. These include the 2000TDX [[LCAC (United Kingdom)|Landing Craft Air Cushion]], the Mk9 and Mk10 [[Landing Craft Utility#United Kingdom|Landing Craft Utility]], the [[LCVP (United Kingdom)#LCVP Mk5|Mk5 Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel]] and the [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|SDV Mk8 Mod 1]] [[Swimmer Delivery Vehicle]] for special forces. Other smaller amphibious craft such as the [[Offshore Raiding Craft]], [[Rigid Raider]] and [[Inflatable Raiding Craft]] are in service in much greater numbers.

===3 Brigade Komando===
{{Main|3 Commando Brigade}}
[[File:British Commandos Patch.svg|left|thumb|upright=.5|Insignia of 3 Commando]]

Operational Command of the five Commandos and the Commando Logistics Regiment is delegated to [[3 Commando Brigade|3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines]], of which they are a part. Based at [[Stonehouse Barracks]], the brigade exercises control as directed by either CINCFLEET or the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]].  As the main combat formation of the Royal Marines, the brigade has its own organic capability to it in the field, 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group, a battalion sized formation providing information operations capabilities, life support and security for the Brigade Headquarters.

In general a rifle company Marine will be a member of a four-man [[fireteam|fire team]], the building block of commando operations. A Royal Marine works with his team in the field and shares accommodation if living in barracks. This structure is a recent development, formerly Commandos were structured similarly to British Army light Infantry [[Battalion]]s.<ref>[http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2000/0012/0000122901.asp# Commando Units To Be Reshaped], Navy News article</ref> During the restructuring of the United Kingdom's military services the Corps evolved from a [[Cold War]] focus on NATO's Northern Flank towards a more expeditionary posture.

===Amphibious Task Group===

Formerly known as the Amphibious Ready Group, the Amphibious Task Group (or ATG) is a mobile, balanced [[amphibious warfare]] force, based on a Commando Group and its supporting assets, that can be kept at high readiness to deploy into an area of operations. The ATG is normally based around specialist amphibious ships, most notably {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, the largest ship in the British fleet. ''Ocean'' was designed and built to accommodate an embarked commando and its associated stores and equipment. The strategy of the ATG is to wait "beyond the horizon" and then deploy swiftly as directed by HM Government. The whole amphibious force is intended to be self-sustaining and capable of operating without host-nation support. The concept was successfully tested in operations in [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/training-and-people/the-rn-today/navy-command-headquarters/fleet-battle-staff/comukamphibfor/index.htm comukamphibfor]</ref>

===Commando Helicopter Force===
The [[Commando Helicopter Force]] (CHF) forms part of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. It comprises four helicopter squadrons and is commanded by the [[Joint Helicopter Command]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/establishments/naval-bases-and-air-stations/rnas-yeovilton/commando-helicopter-force/ Commando Helicopter Force webpage]</ref> It consists of both [[Royal Navy]] (RN) and Royal Marines personnel. RN personnel need not be commando trained. The CHF is neither under the permanent control of [[3 Commando Brigade]] nor that of the Commandant General Royal Marines, but rather is allocated to support Royal Marines units as required.  It uses both [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] medium transport and [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] light transport/reconnaissance [[helicopter]]s to provide aviation support for the Royal Marines.

==Selection and training==
{{Main|Royal Marines selection and training}}
[[File:Royal marine who holds gun.jpeg|left|thumb|A Royal Marine stands beside a tree to sight in his weapon during a training exercise.]]
[[File:Royal Marines snipers displaying their L115A1 rifles.jpg|left|thumb|Royal Marines snipers displaying their L115A1 rifles]]

Royal Marines are required to undergo one of the longest and most physically demanding specialist infantry training regimes in the world. Recruit training lasts for 32 weeks for Marines and 64 weeks for officers. Potential recruits must first undertake a series of interviews, medical tests, an eye/sight test, psychometric tests and a PJFT (Pre-joining fitness test).<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/How-To-Join/Recruitment-Process/Royal-Marines Recruitment Process Royal Marines], royalnavy.mod.uk</ref> Once a potential recruit passes these, enlisted recruits undertake a 3-day selection course called PRMC (Potential Royal Marine Course) and potential officers undertake POC (Potential Officer Course)  both take place at the [[Commando Training Centre Royal Marines]] (CTCRM) in [[Lympstone]], Devon. Officers must also take the [[Admiralty Interview Board]] (AIB).<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Explore-Opportunities/~/media/Files/CNR-PDFs/Admiralty%20Interview%20Board.pdf Admiralty Interview Board (pdf)], royalnavy.mod.uk</ref> Upon passing the 3-day course, recruits then start basic recruit training (RT) at CTCRM.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Unlike in many countries, enlisted Marines and officer Marines often train together for the first 32 weeks. A large proportion of training is carried out on [[Dartmoor]]'s inhospitable terrain and [[Woodbury Common, Devon|Woodbury Common]] woodland. The culmination of their training ends with their infamous commando courses which they initially pre-train for. The commando courses are a series of physical and mental endurance tests that highlight their military professionalism.

Throughout the recruit training, Royal Marines learn and develop many military skills such as weapons handling, marksmanship and proficiency with different firearms, personal administration, marching and parade ground skills, map reading and navigation, physical fitness and mental toughness development, [[fieldcraft]] skills such as camouflage and stalking, basic survival techniques, patrolling and sentry duty development, unarmed and armed [[Close combat|close quarters combat]] (CQC), first aid, underwater escape, chemical biological radiological nuclear (CBRN) training, military communications and signals, teamwork skills, amphibious landings training, and leadership skills for officers to name a few.

The best recruit to finish training is awarded the Kings Badge. King George V directed that his Royal Cypher, surrounded by a laurel wreath, would be known as the King's Badge, and would be awarded to the best all round recruit in the King's Squad, provided that he was worthy of the honour. The badge was to be carried on the left shoulder, and worn in every rank. The King's Badge is not awarded to every squad, and is only presented if a recruit measures up to the very exacting standards required.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kings Squad|work=Royal Navy|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Shore-Establishments/Commando-Training-Centre-Royal-Marines-Lympstone/Kings-Squad|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121124021911/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Shore-Establishments/Commando-Training-Centre-Royal-Marines-Lympstone/Kings-Squad|archivedate=24 November 2012|accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref>

Throughout his career, a Marine can specialise in a number of different roles upon completion of their respective courses after spending 12 years as a general duties (GD) Marine. Examples of some specialisations and different courses includes the mountain leader (ML), physical training instructor (PTI), Assault Engineer (AE), military police (MP), sniper course, medical assistant, pilot, reconnaissance operator (RO), drill instructor, driver, clerk, chef, signaller, combat intelligence, armourer, and heavy weapons training. Royal Marines can also apply for swimmer canoeist/[[Special Boat Service]] selection (SBS) or any other branch of the [[UKSF]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Maritime-Reserves/Royal-Marine-Reserves/Training-and-Education/Commando-specialisations Commando specialisations], royalnavy.mod.uk</ref> All Royal Marines will also conduct training exercises on differing military skills on a regular basis including development in mountain, arctic, jungle, amphibious and desert warfare. They can also be involved in exchange training programs with other countries forces  particularly the [[United States Marine Corps]]<ref name="mod.uk"/> and the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]]/Korps Mariniers.<ref name="royalnavy.mod.uk"/>

==Customs and traditions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2015}}
The Royal Marines have a proud history and unique traditions. With the exceptions of "Gibraltar" and the laurel wreath for the Battle of Belle Island, their colours (flags) do not carry [[battle honours]] in the manner of the regiments of the British Army or of the US Marine Corps, but rather the "globe itself" as a symbol of the Corps. This reflects their engagement, from aboard ship, in a host of naval battles and skirmishes, and amphibious actions, wherever the Royal Navy fought in the age of sail.
[[File:Royal Marine Beret Badge MOD 45151656.jpg|thumb|Royal Marine Beret Badge]]
[[File:Bromsgrove cemetery GWGC Barley.JPG|thumb|Memorial for H Barley of the ''Royal Marine Engineers'']]
The heraldic crest of the Royal Marines commemorates the history of the Corps.  The Lion and Crown denotes a Royal regiment. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] conferred this honour in 1802 "in consideration of the very meritorious services of the Marines in the late war." The "Great Globe itself" was chosen in 1827 by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in place of [[Battle honour]]s to recognise the Marines' service and successes in multiple engagements in every quarter of the world.<ref name=crest/> The laurels are believed to honour the gallantry they displayed during the investment and capture of [[Capture of Belle le|Belle Isle]], off [[Lorient]], in AprilJune 1761. The word ''[[Gibraltar]]'' refers to the [[Capture of Gibraltar]] by a force of Anglo-Dutch Marines in 1704 and the subsequent defence of the strategic fortress throughout a nine-month [[Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar|siege]] against a numerically superior Franco-Spanish force.<ref name=crest/> Their determination and valor throughout the siege led to a contemporary report published in ''The Triumphs of Her Majesty's Arms'' in 1707 to announce: {{Quote|Encouraged by the Prince of Hesse, the garrison did more than could humanly be expected, and the English Marines gained an immortal glory|referred to by Paul Harris Nicolas|Historical record of the Royal marine forces}} There are no other battle honours displayed on the [[colours, standards and guidons|colours]] of the four battalion-sized units of the current Corps. The Latin motto "Per Mare Per Terram" translates into English as "By Sea By Land". Believed to have been first used in 1775 this motto describes the Royal Marines ability in fighting both afloat on-board ships of the Royal Navy, as well as ashore in their many land engagements. The fouled anchor, incorporated into the emblem in 1747, is the badge of the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]] and shows that the Corps is part of the [[Naval Service (United Kingdom)|Naval Service]].

When referring to individual Commandos: 45 Commando is referred to as "four-five" rather than "forty-five commando" as is 42 Commando, 40 Commando is "forty". The only units which carry colours are 40 Commando, 42 Commando, 43 Commando and 45 Commando.

The regimental quick march of the Corps is "[[A Life on the Ocean Wave]]", while the slow march is the [[Preobrazhensky Regiment#March|march]] of the [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]], awarded to the Corps by Admiral of the Fleet [[Earl Mountbatten]] of Burma on the occasion of the Corps's tercentenary in 1964. Lord Mountbatten was Life Colonel Commandant of the Royal Marines until his murder by the IRA in 1979.

Dress headgear is a white Wolseley pattern [[pith helmet]] surmounted by a ball, a distinction once standard for artillerymen. This derives from the part of the Corps that was once the Royal Marine Artillery. Their nickname "Bootneck" derives its origins from the leather 'stock' worn round the neck inside the collar by soldiers (''cf.'' [[Leatherneck]]).
[[File:Royal Marines on Parade in the City of London MOD 45157923.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines on Parade in the City of London marking the 350th anniversary of the Corps in 2014]]
The Royal Marines are allowed by the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] to march through the [[City of London|City]] as a regiment in full array. This dates to the charter of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] that allowed recruiting parties of the Admiral's Regiment of 1664 to enter the City with drums beating and colours flying.

===Seragam===
The modern Royal Marines retain a number of distinctive uniform items. These include the green "Lovat" service dress worn with the [[green beret]], the dark blue parade dress worn with either the white Wolseley Pattern Helmet (commonly referred to as "[[pith helmet]]") or white and red peaked cap, the scarlet and blue [[mess dress]] for officers and senior non-commissioned officers and the white hot-weather uniform of the Band Service.

For historical information regarding Marine uniforms, see ''[[History of the Royal Marines]]''.

==Order of precedence==
As the descendant of the old marine regiments of the [[British Army]], the Royal Marines used to have a position in the [[British Army order of precedence|order of precedence]] of the infantry; this was after the 49th Regiment of Foot, the final lineal descendant of which was the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] (RGBW). Therefore, the Royal Marines would have paraded after the RGBW. This is because the 49th Foot was the last regiment raised prior to the formation of the Corps of Marines as part of the Royal Navy in 1755. In 2007, the RGBW was amalgamated into a large regiment{{ndash}}this new regiment is placed last in the order of precedence, as it is a regiment of rifles. However, as a result of new Army amalgamations the Royal Marines have now been removed from the infantry order of precedence and now always take post, as a constituent part of the Royal Navy (the Senior Service), at the head of the parade alongside the Navy, or alone if the Navy are not represented. Thus, if only the infantry is represented, the Royal Marines would parade before the [[Grenadier Guards]], the senior infantry regiment of the Army.

==Afiliasi==
* '''Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders'''
<!--
Early connections date from Balaclava in the [[Crimean War]] and Lucknow during the [[Indian Mutiny]], but the main association stems from World War II. In July 1940, after the fall of Dunkirk, the 5th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] served with the Royal Marine Brigade for over a year. When the battleships {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} were [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sunk in December 1941]], the Royal Marines survivors joined up with the remnants of the 2nd Battalion, in the [[Fall of Singapore|defence of Singapore]].  They formed what became known as 'The Plymouth Argylls', after the association football team, since both ships were Plymouth manned.  Most of the Highlanders and Marines who survived the bitter fighting were taken prisoner by the Japanese. The Royal Marines inter-unit rugby football trophy is the 'Argyll Bowl', presented to the Corps by the Regiment in 1941. A message of greetings is sent to the Regiment each year on their Regimental Day, 25 October, the anniversary of the Battle of Balaclava in 1854.

*'''The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment'''
<!--
The fore-bearer regiments of the '''[[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]]''', The East Surrey Regiment (Villier's Marines) was initially raised as amphibious troops. They served as Marines for a period. To this day one officer from the Royal Marines serves with the PWRR and Vice Versa. Also the Royal Marine Lanyard is worn by all ranks in Service Dress and Number 2 Dress uniform and barrack dress of PWRR
-->
*'''Netherlands Marine Corps'''<!--

The Royal Marines have close links with the Royal [[Netherlands Marine Corps]], with whom they conduct NATO exercises throughout the year. Formed during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in 1665, the Dutch Marines distinguished themselves in raids on the English coast, where it is likely they met their future counterparts.
Units of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps work in close co-operation with 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines. Operational units of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps are fully integrated into this brigade. This integration is known as the United Kingdom-Netherlands Landing Force and is a component of the United Kingdom-Netherlands Amphibious Force as a key strike force during the Cold War to strengthen the Nordic area.--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2013/may/08/130508-hms-bulwark-arrives-in-the-netherlands|title=HMS Bulwark arrives in the Netherlands to mark amphibious pact|publisher=Royal Navy|date=8 May 2013|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>
